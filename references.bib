	abstract = {Flash floods cause more fatalities than any other weather-related natural hazard and cause significant damage to property and infrastructure. It is important to understand the underlying processes that lead to these infrequent but high-consequence events. Accurately determining the locations of flash flood events can be difficult, which impedes comprehensive research of the phenomena. While some flash floods can be detected by automated means (e.g., streamflow gauges), flash floods (and other severe weather events) are generally based on human observations and may not reflect the actual distribution of event locations. The Storm Data–Storm Events Database, which is produced from National Weather Service reports, was used to locate reported flash floods within the forecast area of the Binghamton, New York, Weather Forecast Office between 2007 and 2013. The distribution of those reports was analyzed as a function of environmental variables associated with flood generation including slope, impervious area, soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat, representative rainfall intensity, and representative rainfall depth, as well as human population. A spatial conditional autoregressive model was used to test the hypothesis that flash flood reports are made more frequently in areas with higher populations, even when other flood-generating processes are considered. Slope, soil saturated hydraulic conductivity, and impervious area are significant predictors of flash flood reports. When population is added as a predictor, the model is similarly robust, but impervious area and ksat are no longer significant predictors. These results may challenge the assumption that flash flood reports are strongly biased by population.},

Generated by River Forecast Centers (RFCs) across the United States, local NWS Weather Forecast Offices compare estimated and forecast rainfall to FFG to monitor and assess flash flooding potential. A national flash flood observation database consisting of reports in the NWS publication Storm Data and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauge measurements are used to determine the skill of FFG over a 4-yr period. FFG skill is calculated at several different precipitation-to-FFG ratios for both observation datasets. Although a ratio of 1.0 nominally indicates a potential flash flooding event, this study finds that FFG can be more skillful when ratios other than 1.0 are considered. When the entire continental United States is considered, the highest observed critical success index (CSI) with 1-h FFG is 0.20 for the USGS dataset, which should be considered a benchmark for future research that seeks to improve, modify, or replace the current FFG system. Regional benchmarks of FFG skill are also determined on an RFC-by-RFC basis. When evaluated against Storm Data reports, the regional skill of FFG ranges from 0.00 to 0.19. When evaluated against USGS stream gauge measurements, the regional skill of FFG ranges from 0.00 to 0.44.},

	abstract = {This study compares the disaster damage records of two of the most widely used disaster databases - EM-DAT and DesInventar for a selected sample of 70 countries over the period 1995–2013. We consider four types of natural disasters – droughts, floods, earthquakes and storms and use descriptive statistics to compare the records of the two databases for the selected datasets in terms of all recorded events, matched events and large-scale events along with few country-specific comparisons. We note significant differences in the damage estimates reported in the two selected datasets. The comparison of the damage estimates for all recorded events shows that the DesInventar dataset has greater number of recorded events than the EM-DAT. The descriptive statistics of the former exhibits larger mean and standard deviation across all disaster types compared to that for the latter. The same is true for the comparison of large-scale disaster events and country-specific comparisons with the DesInventar dataset having higher number of recorded events and larger values for descriptive statistics for the selected country-year. On the contrary, for the hand-matched events data, EM-DAT shows larger mean disaster damages along with a higher statistical range compared to the DesInventar dataset. The basic structure of the datasets and the data collection methods may influence the magnitude of the recorded damages along with possible human errors while data entering. The present study further highlights the need for a more systematic and standardized disaster damages database which is critical to achieve the first priority action ‘understanding disaster risk’ of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.},

	abstract = {Flash floods represent a significant threat, triggering severe natural disasters and leading to extensive damage to properties and infrastructure, which in turn results in the loss of lives and significant economic damages. In this study, a comprehensive statistical approach was applied to future flood predictions in the coastal basin of North Al-Abatinah, Oman. In this context, the initial step involves analyzing eighteen General Circulation Models (GCMs) to identify the most suitable one. Subsequently, we assessed four CMIP6 scenarios for future rainfall analysis. Next, different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were employed through H2O-AutoML to identify the best model for downscaling future rainfall predictions. Forty distribution functions were then fitted to the future daily rainfall, and the best-fit model was selected to project future Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves. Finally, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was utilized with sub-daily time steps to make accurate flash flood predictions in the study area. The findings reveal that IITM-ESM is the most effective among GCM models. Additionally, the application of stacked ensemble ML model proved to be the most reliable in downscaling future rainfall. Furthermore, this study highlighted that floods entering urbanized areas could reach 20.33 and 20.70 m³/s under pessimistic scenarios during rainfall events with 100 and 200-year return periods, respectively. This hierarchical comprehensive approach provides reliable results by utilizing the most effective model at each step, offering in-depth insight into future flash flood prediction.},

The prediction capability of the resulting AI-enhanced algorithm turns out to be significantly higher than that of the fully-deterministic algorithm employed in the ECMWF model. A remarkable Recall peak of about 95\% within the 0-24 h forecast interval is obtained. This performance surpasses the 85\% achieved by the ECMWF model at the same Precision of the AI algorithm.},

	abstract = {Deep learning techniques have been increasingly used in flood management to overcome the limitations of accurate, yet slow, numerical models and to improve the results of traditional methods for flood mapping. In this paper, we review 58 recent publications to outline the state of the art of the field, identify knowledge gaps, and propose future research directions. The review focuses on the type of deep learning models used for various flood mapping applications, the flood types considered, the spatial scale of the studied events, and the data used for model development. The results show that models based on convolutional layers are usually more accurate, as they leverage inductive biases to better process the spatial characteristics of the flooding events. Models based on fully connected layers, instead, provide accurate results when coupled with other statistical models. Deep learning models showed increased accuracy when compared to traditional approaches and increased speed when compared to numerical methods. While there exist several applications in flood susceptibility, inundation, and hazard mapping, more work is needed to understand how deep learning can assist in real-time flood warning during an emergency and how it can be employed to estimate flood risk. A major challenge lies in developing deep learning models that can generalize to unseen case studies. Furthermore, all reviewed models and their outputs are deterministic, with limited considerations for uncertainties in outcomes and probabilistic predictions. The authors argue that these identified gaps can be addressed by exploiting recent fundamental advancements in deep learning or by taking inspiration from developments in other applied areas. Models based on graph neural networks and neural operators can work with arbitrarily structured data and thus should be capable of generalizing across different case studies and could account for complex interactions with the natural and built environment. Physics-based deep learning can be used to preserve the underlying physical equations resulting in more reliable speed-up alternatives for numerical models. Similarly, probabilistic models can be built by resorting to deep Gaussian processes or Bayesian neural networks.},

Recent efforts in hydrology have aimed at predicting water flow, floods, and quality, yet most methodologies overlook the influence of adjacent areas and lack advanced visualization for water level assessment. Our contribution is two-fold: firstly, we introduce a graph neural network model (LocalFLoodNet) equipped with a graph learning module to capture the interconnections of water systems and the connectivity between stations to predict future water levels. Secondly, we develop a simulation prototype offering visual insights for decision-making in disaster prevention and policy-making. This prototype visualizes predicted water levels and facilitates data analysis using decades of historical information. Focusing on the Greater Montreal Area (GMA), particularly Terrebonne, Quebec, Canada, we apply LocalFLoodNet and prototype to demonstrate a comprehensive method for assessing flood impacts. By utilizing a digital twin of Terrebonne, our simulation tool allows users to interactively modify the landscape and simulate various flood scenarios, thereby providing valuable insights into preventive strategies. This research aims to enhance water level prediction and evaluation of preventive measures, setting a benchmark for similar applications across different geographic areas.},

	doi = {10.5194/nhess-23-1157-2023},
	abstract = {On 15 February 2022, the city of Petrópolis in the highlands of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, received an unusually high volume of rain within 3 h (258 mm), generated by a strongly invigorated mesoscale convective system. It resulted in flash floods and subsequent landslides that caused the deadliest landslide disaster recorded in Petrópolis, with 231 fatalities. In this paper, we analyzed the root causes and the key triggering factors of this landslide disaster by assessing the spatial relationship of landslide occurrence with various environmental factors. Rainfall data were retrieved from 1977 to 2022 (a combination of ground weather stations and the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation – CHIRPS). Remotely sensed data were used to map the landslide scars, soil moisture, terrain attributes, line-of-sight displacement (land surface deformation), and urban sprawling (1985–2020). The results showed that the average monthly rainfall for February 2022 was 200 mm, the heaviest recorded in Petrópolis since 1932. Heavy rainfall was also recorded mostly in regions where the landslide occurred, according to analyses of the rainfall spatial distribution. As for terrain, 23 \% of slopes between 45–60∘ had landslide occurrences and east-facing slopes appeared to be the most conducive for landslides as they recorded landslide occurrences of about 9 \% to 11 \%. Regarding the soil moisture, higher variability was found in the lower altitude (842 m) where the residential area is concentrated. Based on our land deformation assessment, the area is geologically stable, and the landslide occurred only in the thin layer at the surface. Out of the 1700 buildings found in the region of interest, 1021 are on the slope between 20 to 45∘ and about 60 houses were directly affected by the landslides. As such, we conclude that the heavy rainfall was not the only cause responsible for the catastrophic event of 15 February 2022; a combination of unplanned urban growth on slopes between 45–60∘, removal of vegetation, and the absence of inspection were also expressive driving forces of this disaster.},

Total rainfall in the city of Recife on May 25–30 was 551 mm, 140 mm higher than the average of the month of May. Rain was heaviest on May 25 and 28, with 100–200 mm and 151–250 mm, respectively. This coincided with easterly wave disturbances. May 28 saw the most rain, due to a significant cold front. Fourteen municipalities in the metropolitan region of Recife declared a state of emergency. According to the Civil Defense of Pernambuco state, the rain impacted 130,000 people there. Most of the heavy precipitation fell over areas with medium to very high geological vulnerability to landslides and extreme hydrological events. The loss of life and substantial economic impacts in Recife caused by the heavy precipitation of May 2022 and the disasters induced by it show that this city, like many others around the world, has limited capacity to cope with climate extremes. Urbanization has increased population density occupying hills and slopes of the city, contributing to the problem. To reduce the impact of such disasters, residents must be made aware of the risks of climate-related events, and they must be encouraged to heed alerts warning of natural disasters issued by state and federal institutions. Efficient monitoring of risk is also needed. Risk management will be viable only when everyone participates, which requires education and cultural change.},

	abstract = {Ensemble Prediction Systems (EPS) from a single Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model often miss out on a few extreme events. Similarly, a single hydrological model cannot capture all types of flows, such as flood peaks, occurring within a watershed due to the inaccurate representation of the real world processes in their mathematical structure. To focus on these aspects, this study proposes five ‘NWP+HM’ combinations (HM refers to Hydrologic Model) to investigate which combination performs better in providing quality flood forecasts. The EPS obtained from THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) archive are forced into calibrated hydrologic models to generate ensemble flood forecasts (EFFs). The methodology also includes a machine-learning post-processing technique, Quantile Regression Forests (QRF), for temporal correction of bias and under-dispersion in the raw EPS data. The study finds that both the EPS used show similar performance in generating flood forecasts. However, the study demonstrates that the hydrologic model uncertainty has a more significant impact on capturing flood peaks compared to input model uncertainty. Finally, the simulated flood forecasts are verified for their quality using both deterministic and probabilistic metrics. For the above five combinations, an increase in leadtime up to 10 days is observed when the raw data are post-processed using QRF technique. The study identifies a computationally efficient ‘NWP+HM’ combination for use in the hydrological forecasting system, which improves the predictability of flood forecasts several days ahead.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.103785},
	abstract = {Non-structural mitigation measures to the globally increasing flood events include forecast based alert generation. However, the extreme rainfall forecasts are associated with low hit rate, high false alarm, and spatiotemporal bias; which makes it difficult to rely on them. Further, the losses due to flood in a region not only depend on rainfall severity but also on topography, socioeconomic conditions and exposure of the region to floods. Here, we introduce a new concept of spatial flood risk mapping and forecasting at weather to medium range based on forecasted hazard, embedded with vulnerability (topographic and socioeconomic) and exposure information. We define hazard as the probability of extreme rainfall event during upcoming days given an available weather forecast for the same days. As hindcast is used for computation of probabilities, hazard contains prior information about the false alarm, hit rate and spatiotemporal bias of the forecast. Vulnerability is calculated by averaging the topographic and socioeconomic indicators, and exposure is calculated using a land use land cover map. Topographic vulnerability is computed with digital elevation model using Height Above the Nearest Drainage method, and Data Envelopment Analysis is performed to derive the socioeconomic vulnerability based on the demographic census data. For a specific region and a specific event, the relative flood risk maps are generated at an administrative level (e.g., district, subdistrict or village level for India) and the high-risk areas can be identified from those maps for mitigation. The methodology is demonstrated for a very recent extremely severe flood event that happened in Kerala, India in August 2018. It is evident from the results that the high-risk areas forecasted well in advance (as high lead time as 15 days) match fairly well with the areas, which suffered maximum losses because of direct flood.},

	abstract = {Flood forecasting may be improved by coupling atmospheric and hydrological models. To investigate the current potential of such an approach in complex mountain watersheds, the authors carried out a number of combined high-resolution one-way driven model experiments to generate runoff hydrographs for seven extreme flood events which occurred in the Lago Maggiore basin between 1993 and 2000. The Alpine Ticino–Verzasca–Maggia basin (2627km2) is located directly to the south of the main Alpine ridge embracing a great part of the drainage area of Lago Maggiore. For this basin, the grid-based hydrological catchment model WaSiM-ETH was employed to determine the continuous runoff hydrographs. In the model experiments, two different sets of meteorological input data were used: (1) surface observation data from station measurements and from weather radar, and (2) forecast data from five different high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) models with grid cell sizes between 2 and 14km. This paper presents and compares selected results of these flood runoff simulations with particular attention to the experimental design of the model coupling. The configuration and initialization of the hydrological model runs are outlined as well as the down-scale techniques which proved to provide an adequate spatial interpolation of the meteorological variables onto the 500m×500m grid of the hydrological model. In order to evaluate the various hydrological model results as generated from the different outputs from the five NWP models, some coupled experiments with ‘non-standard’ NWP model outputs have been carried out. In particular, the results of these sensitivity studies point to inherent limits of high-resolution flood runoff predictions in complex mountain terrain.},

	abstract = {The Ensemble Framework For Flash Flood Forecasting (EF5) was developed specifically for improving hydrologic predictions to aid in the issuance of flash flood warnings by the US National Weather Service. EF5 features multiple water balance models and two routing schemes which can be used to generate ensemble forecasts of streamflow, streamflow normalized by upstream basin area (i.e., unit streamflow), and soil saturation. EF5 is designed to utilize high-resolution precipitation forcing datasets now available in real time. A study on flash-flood-scale basins was conducted over the conterminous United States using gauged basins with catchment areas less than 1000 km2. The results of the study show that the three uncalibrated water balance models linked to kinematic wave routing are skillful in simulating streamflow.},

	abstract = {There are ongoing efforts to move beyond the current paradigm of using deterministic products driven by observation-only data to make binary warning decisions. Recent works have focused on severe thunderstorm hazards, such as hail, lightning, and tornadoes. This study discusses one of the first steps toward having probabilistic information combined with convective-scale short-term precipitation forecasts available for the prediction and warning of flash flooding. Participants in the Hydrometeorology Testbed–MRMS Hydrology (HMT-Hydro) experiment evaluated several probabilistic-based hydrologic model output from the probabilistic Flooded Locations and Simulated Hydrographs (PRO-FLASH) system during experimental real-time warning operations. Evaluation of flash flood warning performance combined with product surveys highlighted how forecasters perceived biases within the probabilistic information and how the different probabilistic approaches influenced warnings that were verified versus those that were unverified. The incorporation of the Warn-on-Forecast System (WoFS) ensemble precipitation forecasts into the PRO-FLASH product generation provided an opportunity to evaluate the first coupling of subhourly convective-scale ensemble precipitation forecasts with probabilistic hydrologic modeling at the flash flood warning time scale through archived case simulations. The addition of WoFS precipitation forecasts resulted in an increase in warning lead time, including four events with ≥29 min of additional lead time but with increased probabilities of false alarms. Additional feedback from participants provided insights into the application of WoFS forecasts into warning decisions, including how flash flood expectations and confidence evolved for verified flash flood events and how forecast probabilistic products can positively influence the communications of the potential for flash flooding.},

	abstract = {Floods are one of the most common natural disasters, with a disproportionate impact in developing countries that often lack dense streamflow gauge networks1. Accurate and timely warnings are critical for mitigating flood risks2, but hydrological simulation models typically must be calibrated to long data records in each watershed. Here we show that artificial intelligence-based forecasting achieves reliability in predicting extreme riverine events in ungauged watersheds at up to a five-day lead time that is similar to or better than the reliability of nowcasts (zero-day lead time) from a current state-of-the-art global modelling system (the Copernicus Emergency Management Service Global Flood Awareness System). In addition, we achieve accuracies over five-year return period events that are similar to or better than current accuracies over one-year return period events. This means that artificial intelligence can provide flood warnings earlier and over larger and more impactful events in ungauged basins. The model developed here was incorporated into an operational early warning system that produces publicly available (free and open) forecasts in real time in over 80 countries. This work highlights a need for increasing the availability of hydrological data to continue to improve global access to reliable flood warnings.},

	doi = {10.1038/s41598-024-59145-w},
	abstract = {Losses from catastrophic floods are driving intense efforts to increase preparedness and improve response to disastrous flood events by providing early warnings. Yet accurate flood forecasting remains a challenge due to uncertainty in modeling, calibrating, and validating a useful early warning system. This paper presents the Requisitely Simple (ReqSim) flood forecasting system that includes key variables and processes of basin hydrology and atmospheric forcing in a data-driven modeling framework. The simplicity of the modeling structure and data requirements of the system allows for customization and implementation in any medium to large rain-fed river basin globally, provided there are water level or discharge measurements at the forecast locations. The proposed system's efficacy is demonstrated in this paper through providing useful forecasts for various river basins around the world. This include 3–10-day forecasts for the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers in South Asia, 2–3-day forecast for the Amur and Yangtze rivers in East Asia, 5–10-day forecasts for the Niger, Congo and Zambezi rivers in West and Central Africa, 6–8-day forecasts for the Danube River in Europe, 2–5-day forecasts for the Parana River in South America, and 2–7-day forecasts for the Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, and Arkansas rivers in the USA. The study also quantifies the effect of basin size, topography, hydrometeorology, and river flow controls on forecast accuracy and lead times. Results indicate that ReqSim's forecasts perform better in river systems with moderate slopes, high flow persistence, and less flow controls. The simple structure, minimal data requirements, ease of operation, and useful operational accuracy make ReqSim an attractive option for effective real-time flood forecasting in medium and large river basins worldwide.},

	volume = {173},
	abstract = {Flash flood, a type of the surface runoff that rises up and down sharply in small watersheds in the hilly and mountainous areas, is a difficulty in flood control and disaster prevention. As a basic unit of people’s social life, community is the most widely involved unit in disaster risk management. Flood-prone communities are characterized by geographical dispersion and confinement. This study carries out a research on disaster resilience and time-varying effects from the perspective of flash flood, and proposes a multidisciplinary integrated approach: (1) A multilevel interpretive structure model of the influencing factors of community resilience based on coupling decision mathematical model was constructed to analyze the differential influencing factors of community resilience; (2) The information diffusion method was used to quantitatively analyze and rank the community resilience of flash flood disasters; (3) Rand Index was used to quantitatively estimate the magnitude of community resilience and analyze the characteristics of its time-varying effect curve. Taking the flood-prone areas in northern Guangdong Province as the research area, this study analyzes three types of communities, including urban, rural, and suburban. The results show that the community resilience indicator system from the perspective of flash flood impact is a multi-dimensional and multi-layered complex network system. The direct influencing factors of community resilience in different types of community are different, the construction of water supply and drainage facilities and the flood emergency drills, as the fundamental influencing factors of community resilience, play an essential role in enhancing community resilience to flash floods. Since most of the surveyed communities are located in areas with frequent flash floods, residents have a high awareness of disaster prevention and mitigation, and rural show the higher community resilience than the sample of urban and suburban. With the expansion of inundation, the resilience of all three types of communities shows a consistent trend of “sharp decrease − rapid increase − slow decrease”. This study can provide an important reference for enhancing the community resilience in the flood-prone areas, and also improving their disaster prevention and mitigation capabilities. This comprehensive analysis method can provide scientific support to the refined prevention and mitigation of other types of disasters.},

In this study, we propose a stacking ensemble learning algorithm that harnesses the strengths of a diverse range of machine learning models. The findings reveal the following: (1) The stacking ensemble learning, using RF-XGB-CB-LR model, significantly enhances flood susceptibility simulation.

	abstract = {Impact-based forecasts and warnings (IbFWs) are used by meteorological agencies to forecast the likelihood and severity of impacts resulting from hydrometeorological hazards. Despite progress developing IbFW approaches the evaluation of IbFWs performance is challenging, partly due to the lack of impact observations. Impact data may provide the observations required to evaluate IbFWs, and publicly accessible impact data are available from a number of diverse sources. However, differences in the purpose, format, and method of collection across agencies has led to a fragmented and inconsistent picture of impacts to date. Furthermore, impact data can suffer from bias. To understand the implications of using impact data for IbF evaluation, we interrogate a range of publicly available impact data sources including structured databases, disaster reports, and dedicated web and news sites. Bias within publicly available impact data was assessed, and the implication of bias on IbFW evaluation considered. We find that each data source investigated has bias, although the type and magnitude of bias varies depending on the data source. Observed biases affect the coverage, severity, timing, geographic scale, and accuracy of impact observations. Furthermore, inconsistences in hazard terminology, poor adoption of unique event identifiers, and the inability to relate impact observations to specific hazardous events presents challenges when using impact data for IbFW evaluation. Despite these challenges, using a range of data sources together can provide a more holistic observation of the impacts of hydrometeorological events. Consolidating impact observations from a range of sources may produce the data required for IbFW evaluation.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ijdrr.2024.104608},
	abstract = {Globally, there are different scientific methods being developed to support the provision of Impact-based Forecasts and Warnings. Impact data is critically valuable to many of these methods enabling the development of new hazard impact models and forecasting applications, and the evaluation of these different products. However, routine and consistent approaches to collect socio-economic impact information remain challenging, with traditional approaches being labour intensive, error prone and unsustainable. This paper describes the design of an automated workflow that can collect, standardise, and harmonise impact observations from a range of sources, routinely. The workflow is a 6-step process including web scraping, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and geoparsing. The workflow enables essential criteria (i.e., date, location, types and details of the societal impacts and the hazard(s) which led to them) to be captured faster than previous manual approaches. It also allows a wider range of hazard and impact types to be collected than was previously practical to do. Testing of the workflow indicates that it could benefit from further refinement of the NLP and geoparse modules to allow for the detection of finer scale impact locations. This in turn would allow for different scales of event detection to be developed and tested. Additionally, the applicability of the workflow for different types of impact data sources such as news and social media remains to be tested. Despite the need for further refinement, this workflow represents a step change in the speed and efficiency of impact data collection within the Met Office.},

The peak unit discharge of major rivers also reflects precipitation-generating mechanisms. The flood hydroclimatology of the major rivers of low latitudes, such as the Amazon, Congo, and Zambezi, shows low variability in monthly and annual peak discharge. Rivers of arid and semiarid regions are distinguished by generally low values of peak discharge per unit drainage area because some part of the basin does not effectively contribute surface runoff during peak discharges. The rivers of the mid-latitudes of North America and Europe have climates in which diverse circulation patterns produce precipitation. The rivers of East and Southeast Asia, which drain mostly the mid-latitudes, have seasonally or perennially barotropic climates.},

The objective of this work is to create a data-driven model to understand how predisposing factors influence the spatial variation of the triggering factor (rainfall intensity) in the case of flash floods in the continental area of Portugal. Flash floods occurrences were extracted from the DISASTER database. We extracted the accumulated precipitation from the Copernicus database by considering two days of duration. The analysed predisposing factors for flooding were extracted considering the whole basin where each occurrence is located. These factors include the basin area, the predominant lithology, drainage density, and the mean or median values of elevation, slope, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), roughness, and four soil properties. The Random Forest algorithm was used to build the models and obtained mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) around 19},

	volume = {117},
	doi = {10.1002/bdr2.2443},
	abstract = {Infant mortality remains a critical public health issue, reflecting the overall health and well-being of a population. Accurate prediction of infant mortality is crucial, as it enables healthcare providers to identify at-risk populations and implement targeted interventions. By analyzing factors such as maternal education, prenatal care access, nutrition, and environmental influences, predictions help in designing effective programs aimed at reducing infant deaths. This research paper aims to predict infant mortality in India by employing ensemble learning techniques, specifically eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), stacking, adaptive boosting, and bagging. The data for the analysis are sourced from national surveys and demographic studies focusing on infant mortality in India. The collected data underwent rigorous preprocessing steps to prepare it for predictive modeling. Each ensemble learning model is applied to predict infant mortality rates based on the preprocessed data. The XGBoost handles complex and non-linear relationships within the data, and the stacking model is used for the accurate and robust predictions. The adaptive boosting model iteratively trains multiple weak learners, which makes the predictive model as stronger. The adaptive boosting technique enhances the performance of weak classifiers while effectively addressing class imbalance issues. Further, the bagging approach is implemented to derive the linear and non-linear relationships of infant mortality. Models were optimized using k-fold cross-validation to fine-tune their hyper parameters. The predictive ability of the ensemble techniques is analyzed by deploying using different performance parameters. XGBoost attained superior performance results, with a 98.75},

	abstract = {This study addresses the challenges of flash flood susceptibility mapping in Yemen’s Qaa’Jahran Basin, characterized by complex terrain and limited hydro-meteorological data. To enhance predictive accuracy, we integrate metaheuristic feature selection with ensemble learning models. Initially, fifteen flash flood variables were retrieved using Geographic Information System (GIS) based remote sensing, setting the stage for a novel feature selection algorithm. Then, the Memo Search Algorithm (MSA), a metaheuristic approach is proposed to efficiently reduce feature space. Through comprehensive comparisons with established algorithms such as the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO), MSA refined the selection, identifying 'elevation’ and 'distance to streams’ as optimal factors. Statistical validations using the Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests confirmed the significant superiority of MSA over competing algorithms. Ensemble classifiers (bagging, boosting, stacking) were then applied to the reduced feature space. Comprehensive evaluation revealed the boosting ensemble with MSA outperformed traditional techniques reaching 98.75},

However, the credibility of counterfactual scenarios decreases with the distance rain fields are transposed across space. We limit that distance by a local counterfactual search design and compare the corresponding scenarios to recently published results from long-distance transpositions. We then put all scenarios into context with 200-year return levels and with flood peaks simulated for the June 2024 flood event in southern Germany. We conclude that local counterfactual scenarios are transparent and credible and could complement the anticipation of low-probability events.},

	abstract = {This study proposes an integrated hydrometeorological modelling framework approach and methodology for flash flood Early Warning Systems in the Chugoku region of Japan. Unprecedented rainfall-induced hydrometeorological disasters and flash floods are increasingly occurring worldwide. Comprehensive efforts are conducted to simultaneously combine multiple disciplines into integrated modelling framework approaches to reduce disaster resilience. This enables more accurate hindcasts, reanalyses, real-time forecasts or nowcasts for flash floods. This study integrates proposed hydrological calibration approach with meteorological input. Two real-time rainfall forecasts by the Weather Research and Forecasting model forced by the Atmospheric Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) and the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA55) were used as input data to the hydrological model ensemble parameterized previously. This approach was applied to seven major rivers to evaluate river discharges real-time forecasts accuracy during the Heavy Rainfall Event of July 2018. Long lead-times of up to 29 h with a satisfactory reproducible range of Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency were obtained using both meteorological forecast for all rivers cumulatively. This indicates that the proposed integrated hydrometeorological approach enables accurate flash flood real-time forecasting for this event. Similarly, the joint hydrometeorological approach enables framework for development of real-time flash food forecasting application in Japan and presumably worldwide.},

	abstract = {The present study investigates into genesis, intensification, dynamical behavior and the prediction of Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm (ESCS) ‘Fani' over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) in the National Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) global numerical weather prediction (NWP) modeling system ‘NCUM.’ The global model is adopted from the UK Met office's Unified Model (UM). The ESCS ‘Fani' formed from 26 April–04 May 2019, over the warm waters of BoB. In the criterion of landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs), which crossed the Orissa coast, it was the most intense cyclonic storm during pre-monsoon season since 1965. The TC exhibited a markedly different characteristic having genesis very near to the equator (near 2.7°N and 88.7°E) and possessing one of the longest tracks ( 3030-km) over the BoB region. The NCUM global model was operationally run during the occurrence of the TC. The diagnosis of the TC's genesis and rapid intensification (RI) in the model is carried out using various metrics such as Genesis potential parameter (GPP), winds at 850-hPa, vertically integrated moisture flux, potential vorticity (PV) at isentropic level 315 K, Severe Weather Threat (SWEAT) index and daily averaged latent heat flux, etc. It is found that the early genesis, structure, RI, and movement of the TC were well captured by the model in advance. The Model predicted TC tracks for a total of seven initial conditions (from 27 April to 03 May 2019, at 24-h interval) are found closely co-related with the observed best track of the TC provided by India Meteorological Department (IMD). The lower values of Direct Position Errors (DPEs), along-track errors (ATEs), and cross-track errors (CTEs) indicate the skillful prediction of the TC by the model. The structure, amplitude, and location (SAL) simulated precipitation of the TC over the BoB and along the central-east coast of India are in agreement with the observed systems. Our detailed diagnostic analysis suggests that the TC formation, development, and intensification was mostly controlled by the warmer BoB sea surface temperatures.},

El estudio de la percepción social del riesgo de desastres, es una de las principales herramientas que impulsa la gestión del riesgo en comunidades, he ahí la importancia de considerar la apreciación de las personas sobre su entorno geográfico como factor indispensable en la generación de normativas y políticas públicas que reduzcan niveles de riesgo. La metodología para describir el nivel y la caracterización de la percepción social del riesgo frente a inundaciones se basa en el diseño de encuestas aplicadas a 67 jefes de hogar del cantón Santa Cruz. La estructura de la encuesta agrupa 4 temáticas: percepción general del encuestado, percepción de la amenaza, percepción de la vulnerabilidad frente a la amenaza y finalmente percepción de la capacidad de respuesta y prevención ante a la amenaza. Adicionalmente, en la elaboración del mapa de riesgos de inundación se considera el factor vulnerabilidad que identifica impactos potenciales en elementos expuestos, a más de caracterizar el fenómeno físico de inundación como tal. A partir de este análisis se han obtenido resultados que identifican un moderado nivel de percepción del riesgo de los habitantes en el cantón Santa Cruz, con una dimensión del comportamiento que señala un “locus de control” interno, el cual posibilita el desarrollo de estrategias preventivas ante eventos adversos.},

Results reveal stark regional patterns of changing flood risk that are broadly consistent above the four flood categories. We show that these patterns are dependent on the overall wetness and potential water storage, with fundamental implications for water resources management, agriculture, insurance, navigation, ecology, and populations living in flood-affected areas. Our findings may assist in a better communication of changing flood patterns to a wider audience compared with the more traditional approach of stating trends in terms of discharge magnitudes and frequencies.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a key control on runoff generation and biogeochemical processes on hillslopes. Precipitation events can evoke different soil moisture responses with depth through the soil profile, and responses can differ among landscape positions along a hillslope. We sought to elucidate the nature of these responses by estimating changes in water content, response time between peak precipitation and peak soil moisture, and wetting front velocities for 43 storms at 45 locations on three adjacent hillslopes within a headwater catchment of the southern Appalachian Mountains (NC, USA). We used a multivariate modeling approach to quantify the relative influences and the predictability of soil moisture responses by a combination of landscape and storm characteristics. We quantified the lag correlations between hillslope mean soil moisture and catchment runoff to demonstrate how storm properties and hillslope-scale characteristics may influence runoff at the catchment outlet. Soil moisture responses varied widely, and no consistent patterns were observed among response metrics laterally or vertically along hillslopes. In contrast to other studies, we found that the relative influence of hillslope properties and storm characteristics varied with soil moisture responses and during storms. Antecedent conditions and storm depths influenced the strength of lag correlations between soil moisture and runoff, whereas storm mean intensity was correlated with the lag times. These results highlight the utility of intensive observations for characterizing heterogeneity in soil moisture responses, suggesting, among other things, a need for better representation of the subsurface processes in rainfall-runoff models. Identifying the relative importance of drivers can be beneficial in building parsimonious hydrological models.},

	abstract = {The Meteorological Service of Canada held a series of three Forecasters Forum meetings between 2003 and 2005 to seek input from the meteorological community on the best ways to implement a restructuring strategy and to develop a common vision related to the provision of weather forecasts. The meeting provided significant insight into a number of topics related to operational forecasting in Canada and have added to the larger discussion on these issues in the international meteorological community. During the course of the three forums, several themes emerged as overarching concerns. Foremost among them was the future role of the human forecaster. Most forum participants believed that human forecasters should be the “heart of weather prediction,” with an increased emphasis on the analysis/diagnosis/prognosis paradigm, and recommended developing the sophisticated tools required to facilitate that role. Using results from the forums, it is suggested here that the primary role of the future forecaster should be to develop and maintain a sequence of plan-view composite depictions evolving through time to best represent the current and future states of the atmosphere. This would be accomplished using an area-based, object-oriented analysis/forecast system, with a toolbox of numerical weather prediction guidance and carefully designed artificial intelligence assistants. The forecaster's work would be focused on high-impact weather events, mainly in the short term but also in the longer term when necessary. Products would be automatically generated from the weather object database, allowing the forecast team to focus on “hands on” meteorology and maintaining shared situational awareness at all times.},

	abstract = {The northeastern depressed region of Bangladesh is highly susceptible to recurrent flash flooding due to excessive rainfall over these areas and in the upstream hilly regions. Two such severe pre-monsoon flash flood events occurred in 2016 and 2017. This research attempts to forecast both flash flood events using a coupled atmospheric-hydrological numerical weather prediction (NWP) model, namely the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model. The ARW (Advanced Research WRF) model is able to predict the rainfall over these areas with a lead time of 91 h. However, the discharge and water level are overestimated by the WRF-Hydro model. The model predicts a flash flood with a lag of approximately 12 h with respect to the highest amount of rainfall. The overall performances of the models were satisfactory. The two parameters, rainfall and subsequent discharge, which are required for delineation of lag time, were almost precisely simulated. Simulated values also had fewer errors, justified by the root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error values. The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency criterion scores for model-derived discharge were close to 1.0, and the RMSE-observation standard deviation ratio scores were less than 0.5. This finding proves that the NWP models could be considered for forecasting flash flood events over selected areas of Bangladesh.},

This paper reviewed and compared methods for assessing and enhancing the extrapolability of both model types, discussing their prospects and limitations. Key strategies include the use of leave-one-out cross-validation and similarity-based methods to evaluate model performance in ungauged regions.

	abstract = {Reliable reanalysis products can be exploited to drive mesoscale numerical models and generate high-resolution reconstructions of high-impact weather events. Within this framework, regional weather and climate models may greatly benefit from the recent release of the ERA5 product, an improvement to the ERA-Interim dataset. In this study, two different convection-permitting models driven by these two reanalysis datasets are used to reproduce three heavy precipitation events affecting a Mediterranean region. Moreover, different sea surface temperature (SST) initializations are tested to assess how higher-resolution SST fields improve the simulation of high-impact events characterized by strong air–sea interactions. Finally, the coupling with a distributed hydrological model allows evaluating the impact at the ground, specifically assessing the possible added value of the ERA5 dataset for the high-resolution simulation of extreme hydrometeorological events over the Calabria region (southern Italy). Results, based on the comparison against multiple-source precipitation observations, show no clear systematic benefit to using the ERA5 dataset; moreover, intense convective activity can introduce uncertainties masking the signal provided by the boundary conditions of the different reanalyses. The effect of the high-resolution SST fields is even more difficult to detect. The uncertainties propagate and amplify along the modeling chain, where the spatial resolution increases up to the hydrological model. Nevertheless, even in very small catchments, some of the experiments provide reasonably accurate results, suggesting that an ensemble approach could be suitable to cope with uncertainties affecting the overall meteo-hydrological chain, especially for small catchments.},

Unfortunately, some studies have confused the two methods, while others did not acknowledge multiple possibilities of neighborhood approach application and simply stated, “a neighborhood approach was applied” without supporting details. Thus, this paper reviews applications of neighborhood approaches to convection-allowing ensembles in hopes of clarifying the two methods and their different event definitions.

Predicting pluvial floods is difficult and many cities do not have a hydrodynamic model or an early warning system in place. Citizen science and crowdsourcing have the potential for contributing to early warning systems (EWS) and can also provide data for validating flood forecasting models. Although there are increasing applications of citizen science and crowdsourcing in fluvial hydrology, less is known about activities related to pluvial flooding. Hence the aim of this paper is to review current activities in citizen science and crowdsourcing with respect to applications of pluvial flooding. Based on a search in Scopus, the papers were first filtered for relevant content and then classified into four main themes. The first two themes were divided into (i) applications relevant during a flood event, which includes automated street flooding detection using crowdsourced photographs and sensors, analysis of social media, and online and mobile applications for flood reporting; and (ii) applications related to post-flood events. The use of citizen science and crowdsourcing for model development and validation is the third theme while the development of integrated systems is theme four. All four main areas of research have the potential to contribute to EWS and build community resilience. Moreover, developments in one will benefit others, e.g., further developments in flood reporting applications and automated flood detection systems will yield data useful for model validation.},

While precipitation biases varied geographically and seasonally, 1-km model climatologies of precipitation generally aligned better with those observed than 3-km climatologies. Additionally, during the cool season and spring, when large-scale forcing was strong and precipitation entities were large, 1-km forecasts were more skillful than 3-km forecasts, particularly over southern portions of the CONUS where instability was greatest. Conversely, during summertime, when synoptic-scale forcing was weak and precipitation entities were small, 3- and 1-km forecasts had similar skill. These collective results differ substantially from previous work finding 4-km forecasts had comparable springtime precipitation forecast skill as 1- or 2-km forecasts over the central–eastern CONUS. Additional analyses and experiments suggest the greater benefits of 1-km forecasts documented here could be related to higher-quality initial conditions than in prior studies.

One MPAS ensemble had a quasi-uniform 15-km mesh while the other employed a variable-resolution mesh with 3-km cell spacing over the conterminous United States (CONUS) that smoothly relaxed to 15 km over the rest of the globe. Precipitation forecasts from both MPAS ensembles were objectively verified over the central and eastern CONUS to assess the potential benefits of configuring MPAS with a 3-km mesh refinement region for medium-range forecasts. In addition, forecasts from NCEP’s operational Global Ensemble Forecast System were evaluated and served as a baseline against which to compare the experimental MPAS ensembles. The 3-km MPAS ensemble most faithfully reproduced the observed diurnal cycle of precipitation throughout the 132-h forecasts and had superior precipitation skill and reliability over the first 48 h. However, after 48 h, the three ensembles had more similar spread, reliability, and skill, and differences between probabilistic precipitation forecasts derived from the 3- and 15-km MPAS ensembles were typically statistically insignificant. Nonetheless, despite fewer benefits of increased resolution for spatial placement after 48 h, 3-km ensemble members explicitly provided potentially valuable guidance regarding convective mode throughout the 132-h forecasts while the other ensembles did not. Collectively, these results suggest both strengths and limitations of medium-range high-resolution ensemble forecasts and reveal pathways for future investigations to improve understanding of high-resolution global ensembles with variable-resolution meshes.},

	title = {Heavy rainfall and flash flooding},
	abstract = {Heavy precipitation, which in many contexts is welcomed because it provides the water necessary for agriculture and human use, in other situations is responsible for deadly and destructive flash flooding. Over the 30-year period from 1986 to 2015, floods were responsible for more fatalities in the United States than any other convective weather hazard (www.nws.noaa.gov/om/hazstats.shtml), and similar findings are true in other regions of the world. Although scientific understanding of the processes responsible for heavy rainfall continues to advance, there are still many challenges associated with predicting where, when, and how much precipitation will occur. Common ingredients are required for heavy rainfall to occur, but there are vastly different ways in which the atmosphere brings the ingredients together in different parts of the world. Heavy precipitation often occurs on very small spatial scales in association with deep convection (thunderstorms), factors that limit the ability of numerical models to represent or predict the location and intensity of rainfall. Furthermore, because flash floods are dependent not only on precipitation but also on the characteristics of the underlying land surface, there are fundamental difficulties in accurately representing these coupled processes. Areas of active current research on heavy rainfall and flash flooding include investigating the storm-scale atmospheric processes that promote extreme precipitation, analyzing the reasons that some rainfall predictions are very accurate while others fail, improving the understanding and prediction of the flooding response to heavy precipitation, and determining how heavy rainfall and floods have changed and may continue to change in a changing climate.},

This nocturnal MCS produced in excess of 300 mm of rain in a small area to the southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Operational model forecasts and simulations using a convective parameterization scheme failed to produce the observed rainfall totals for this event.

In both observations and simulations, scattered elevated convective cells were repeatedly initiated 50–75 km upstream before merging into the mature MCS and contributing to the heavy rainfall. Lifting provided by the interaction between the LLJ and the MCV assisted in initiating and maintaining the convection. Simulations indicate that the MCS was long lived despite the lack of a convectively generated cold pool at the surface. Instead, a nearly stationary low-level gravity wave helped to organize the convection into a quasi-linear system that was conducive to extreme local rainfall amounts. Idealized simulations of convection in a similar environment show that such a low-level gravity wave is a response to diabatic heating and that the vertical wind profile featuring a strong reversal of the wind shear with height is responsible for keeping the wave nearly stationary. In addition, the convective system acted to reintensify the midlevel MCV and also caused a distinct surface low pressure center to develop in both the observed and simulated system.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.wace.2021.100372},
	abstract = {Heavy precipitation episodes are particularly hazardous in mid-sized alpine catchments where runoff tends to increase rapidly after strong rainfall, leaving limited time for warning. A high-quality, unbiased forecast of heavy precipitation with long enough lead times (2–5 days) and an adequate spatial resolution is thus crucial for decision makers. However, at present, weather forecast models are sometimes still too coarsely resolved for such catchments or limited to short lead times. Here we present a computationally cheap post-processing approach for operational applications to bias-correct deterministic heavy precipitation forecasts at medium-range lead times. We assessed forecast performance of uncorrected ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) high-resolution (HRES) and ensemble median run (ENS) forecasts with lead times of 2 and 5 days between 2010 and 2019 and evaluated the improvement after interpolation and bias correction. The study is based on observations from 787 meteorological stations, with a focus on areal precipitation in three medium-sized Swiss catchments (Emme, Simme, and Vispa). We found a significantly higher performance of the HRES forecast compared to ENS, especially for a lead time of 5 days. The post-processing approach that we present in this study removes large biases, and lowers false alarm rates. Nonetheless, improvements may be limited for single heavy precipitation events where the model considerably underestimates daily precipitation. Also, a lower false alarm rate can be at the cost of lower hit rates. Quantile mapping is clearly limited for short term prediction in the cases where the error does not substantially exceed natural variability. Despite these limitations, we conclude that bias-corrected forecasts can help improving forecast credibility, which is a key element for decision makers to take actions.},

	abstract = {The effects of spatial variability of rainfall, geomorphology, and climatology of precipitation and temperature on the hydrologic response remain poorly understood. This study characterizes the catchment response in terms of a variable called flashiness, that describes the severity of the flood response as the rate of rise of the unit discharge. It overcomes limitations of prior works based on limited case studies or simulations by gathering information on basins of widely varying characteristics and by using a high-resolution rainfall and flooding event data set spanning 10 years over the Continental United States. The objective is to develop a robust understanding of how rainfall spatial variability influences flash flood severity and to assess its contribution relative to basin physiography and climatology. This study explores the first-order dependencies as well as the variability in these relationships and investigates the complex interactions using a multi-dimensional statistical modeling approach. The results confirm that the spatial organization of rainfall influences the basin response on par with geomorphology and climatology. Basin physiography dampens the effect of lower rainfall intensities, while higher rainfall overwhelms other factors and primarily contributes to flashiness. Dispersion of precipitation with respect to the flow path decreases flood severity. An improved understanding of sub-basin scale rainfall spatial variability aids in developing a robust flash flood severity index to identify and mitigate flash flooding situations as well as identifying basins which could most benefit from distributed hydrologic modeling.},

The focus of this study was to characterize the extent of the link between hydrologists and crisis managers. It also aimed to determine the limiting and the fostering factors to an effective integration of forecasting in crisis management during flash floods. This was achieved through an extensive and methodological study of available literature in selected platforms. The models encountered were characterized on multiple levels including the physical, geographical and crisis management level. The results revealed a limited link between the two involved parties with limiting factors such as the complexity of the modeling approach, the insufficient projection in the implications of operationality of the models proposed and the financial aspect. On the other hand, acknowledging the threat of flash-floods and conducting cost-benefit analysis were pinpointed as fostering factors. This study showed to reconsider the forecasting methods employed, particularly, the integration of machine learning, and the needs of end-user in these applications in a crisis management context.},

	abstract = {The present study aims to investigate how large-scale atmospheric circulation may influence flash floods in Portugal. For this purpose, weather types (WTs) in a northeastern North Atlantic sector are used and flash floods between 1950 and 2003 were identified in six hydrographic basins: three in the north of Portugal and another three in the south of Portugal. An adapted methodology for flash flood detection on daily discharges is applied. A total of 131 flash floods were detected: 35 in the northern basins and 96 in the southern basins. WTs are identified using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 20th Century Reanalysis V2. The sea level pressure composites for flash flood days by WT reveal the large-scale atmospheric patterns underlying their occurrence. The results show that the cyclonic (C) type was strongly associated with flash flood days in the northern basins. The C type pattern features deep low pressure systems north of Iberia, much stronger than average for this WT. For the southern basins, the C type still shows the highest relevance for flood occurrence, but to a lesser extent, since the easterly wind (E) and dual anticyclonic (AA) types also acquire some importance. The flash flood-inducing AA-type events are characterized by atypical largely zonal troughs extending towards Portugal. The flash flood-inducing E type events hint at the occurrence of anomalously strong cut-off low pressure systems over southern Portugal. Although the significance of these systems to precipitation in Portugal was addressed in previous studies, a systematized assessment of their role on flash flood occurrences is herein provided for the first time. The presented flash flood detection methodology can be applied to other regions where hourly flow discharge data are not available, thus being an alternative to the more conventional detection algorithms.},

	abstract = {Flooding remains one of the most devastating and costly natural disasters. As flooding events grow in frequency and intensity, it has become increasingly important to improve flood monitoring, prediction, and early warning systems. Recent efforts to improve flash flood forecasts using deep learning have shown promise, yet commonly-used techniques such as long short term memory (LSTM) models are unable to extract potentially significant spatial relationships among input datasets. Here we propose a hybrid approach using a Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) network to predict stream stage heights using multi-modal hydrometeorological remote sensing and in-situ inputs. Results suggest the hybrid network can more effectively capture the specific spatiotemporal landscape dynamics of a flash flood-prone catchment relative to the current state-of-the-art, leading to a roughly 26},

	abstract = {Google's operational flood forecasting system was developed to provide accurate real-time flood warnings to agencies and the public with a focus on riverine floods in large, gauged rivers. It became operational in 2018 and has since expanded geographically. This forecasting system consists of four subsystems: data validation, stage forecasting, inundation modeling, and alert distribution. Machine learning is used for two of the subsystems. Stage forecasting is modeled with the long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and the linear models. Flood inundation is computed with the thresholding and the manifold models, where the former computes inundation extent and the latter computes both inundation extent and depth. The manifold model, presented here for the first time, provides a machine-learning alternative to hydraulic modeling of flood inundation. When evaluated on historical data, all models achieve sufficiently high-performance metrics for operational use. The LSTM showed higher skills than the linear model, while the thresholding and manifold models achieved similar performance metrics for modeling inundation extent. During the 2021 monsoon season, the flood warning system was operational in India and Bangladesh, covering flood-prone regions around rivers with a total area close to 470 000 km2, home to more than 350 000 000 people. More than 100 000 000 flood alerts were sent to affected populations, to relevant authorities, and to emergency organizations. Current and future work on the system includes extending coverage to additional flood-prone locations and improving modeling capabilities and accuracy.},

	volume = {14},
	doi = {10.1038/s41598-024-53535-w},
	abstract = {The Himalayan region, characterized by its substantial topographical scale and elevation, exhibits vulnerability to flash floods and landslides induced by natural and anthropogenic influences. The study focuses on the Himalayan region, emphasizing the pivotal role of geographical and atmospheric parameters in flash flood occurrences. Specifically, the investigation delves into the intricate interactions between atmospheric and surface parameters to elucidate their collective contribution to flash flooding within the Nainital region of Uttarakhand in the Himalayan terrain. Pre-flood parameters, including total aerosol optical depth, cloud cover thickness, and total precipitable water vapor, were systematically analyzed, revealing a noteworthy correlation with flash flooding event transpiring on October 17th, 18th, and 19th, 2021. Which resulted in a huge loss of life and property in the study area. Contrasting the October 2021 heavy rainfall with the time series data (2000–2021), the historical pattern indicates flash flooding predominantly during June to September. The rare occurrence of October flash flooding suggests a potential shift in the area's precipitation pattern, possibly influenced by climate change. Robust statistical analyses, specifically employing non-parametric tests including the Autocorrelation function (ACF), Mann–Kendall (MK) test, Modified Mann–Kendall, and Sen's slope (q) estimator, were applied to discern extreme precipitation characteristics from 2000 to 201. The findings revealed a general non-significant increasing trend, except for July, which exhibited a non-significant decreasing trend. Moreover, the results elucidate the application of Meteosat-8 data and remote sensing applications to analyze flash flood dynamics. Furthermore, the research extensively explores the substantial roles played by pre and post-atmospheric parameters with geographic parameters in heavy rainfall events that resulted flash flooding, presenting a comprehensive discussion. The findings describe the role of real time remote sensing and satellite and underscore the need for comprehensive approaches to tackle flash flooding, including mitigation. The study also highlights the significance of monitoring weather patterns and rainfall trends to improve disaster preparedness and minimize the impact of flash floods in the Himalayan region.},

This study evaluates the most widely used machine-learning breast cancer prediction and diagnosis methods. We use synthetic minority over-sampling to handle imbalanced data in the breast cancer diagnosis dataset obtained from the Wisconsin Machine Learning Repository. We use a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Naive Bayes (NB), and well-known ensembles methods like Majority-Voting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost), and Random Forest (RF) for the breast cancer classification. The findings show that the Majority-Voting ensemble method, built on the top three classifiers (LR, SVM, and CART), outperforms all other individual classifiers and offers the highest accuracy of 99.3},

	volume = {22},
	doi = {10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.09.036},
	abstract = {Recent extreme rainfall events have led to frequent flash flood-debris flow hazards in the mountainous regions of western and northern Beijing, China, resulting in significant loss of life and property. To decipher the formation mechanism and hazard characteristics of these local disasters, the July 2023 flash flood-debris flow in Hantai Village (HTV) and Hantai Gully (HTG) of Changping District, Beijing, was selected as the focus of this study. This study acquired topographic and geological data of the study area through regional disaster investigation, field surveys in severely affected regions, and indoor assessments and analyses, utilizing 1: 1000 topographic maps and 1: 20,000 geological maps sourced from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images. Then, the characteristics of rainfall and the associated hazard processes (flash flood and debris flow) were systematically investigated and analyzed. By further exploring the formation mechanism of these events, relevant hazard prevention and mitigation suggestions were proposed. The results indicate that the total flood volume in the upstream channel of HTG is approximately 6870 m3 within 1 h, demonstrating significant destructive power. The leading edge of the flash flood/debris flow exits the gully (the southern entrance of HTV) at an instantaneous speed of 74.47 km/h and maintained a speed of 16.42 km/h by the time it reached the northern exit of HTV (outlet of the HTG), with a movement time of 1.83 min. This brief event duration presents significant challenges for timely evacuation. This catastrophic flash flood-debris flow event is identified as a compound hazard triggered by extreme rainfall from the remnant circulation of Typhoon Doksuri, with the sudden increase in surface runoff amount due to short-term heavy rainfall being the primary cause. It is hypothesized that the debris flow occurred later than the flash flood or during the weakening period of the flash flood and was subsequently eroded by weak flood flows, demonstrating clear characteristics of a mutual transformation between flash flood and debris flow. This study provides fundamental support and reference for hazard prevention and response improvement in other small watersheds.},

	volume = {18},
	doi = {10.1111/jfr3.70026},
	abstract = {Owing to the increased frequency of short-duration extreme rainfall events caused by climate change, peak flood flows are expected to increase substantially in small and medium-sized rivers (SMRs) with a short time of concentration for a catchment (Tc). Accurate flood forecasts and corresponding evacuation are effective in reducing the number of casualties caused by flash floods in SMRs. Currently, flood forecasting using observed rainfall in SMRs has a short lead time, which often delays the issuance of evacuation orders by local governments. Moreover, the large number of SMRs necessitates a system that can be widely used by local governments for disaster response tasks, such as issuing evacuation orders. Therefore, we developed a system that can accurately predict when river water levels will reach the Flood Risk Level (FRL). This forecasting approach uses the rainfall–runoff–inundation (RRI) model and the H–Q equation. The parameters in the RRI model were optimized using the Shuffled Complex Evolution algorithm developed at the University of Arizona (SCE-UA) to reduce the required time and effort. The system uses real-time water level observation data to sequentially modify the basin state quantities in the RRI model using the particle filter method to improve the water level forecast accuracy. The system was implemented in 200 rivers in Japan with diverse rainfall and geological characteristics and was tested during the flood season. Accuracy verification was conducted when the forecasted water levels were operated within a range of ± 50 cm. The results showed that 75},

	abstract = {This paper presents a system of sensors used in flash flood prediction that offers critical real-time information used to provide early warnings that can provide the minutes needed for persons to evacuate before imminent events. Flooding is one of the most serious natural disasters humans confront in terms of loss of life and results in long-term effects, which often have severely adverse social consequences. However, flash floods are potentially more dangerous to life because there is often little or no forewarning of the impending disaster. The Emergency Water Information Network (EWIN) offers a solution that integrates an early warning system, notifications, and real-time monitoring of flash flood risks. The platform has been implemented in Colima, Mexico covering the Colima and Villa de Alvarez metropolitan area. This platform consists of eight fixed riverside hydrological monitoring stations, eight meteorological stations, nomadic mobile monitoring stations called “drifters” used in the flow, and a sniffer with data muling capability. The results show that this platform effectively compiles and forwards information to decision-makers, government officials, and the general public, potentially providing valuable minutes for people to evacuate dangerous areas.},

	doi = {10.1175/JHM-D-18-0092.1},
	abstract = {Quantitative precipitation estimate (QPE) exceedances of numerous different heavy precipitation thresholds—including spatially varying average recurrence interval (ARI) and flash flood guidance (FFG) thresholds—are compared among each other and against reported and warned flash floods to quantify existing deficiencies with QPEs and to identify best practices for using QPE for flash flood forecasting and analysis. QPEs from three different sources—NCEP Stage IV Precipitation Analysis (ST4), Climatology Calibrated Precipitation Analysis (CCPA), and Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) QPE—are evaluated across the United States from January 2015 to June 2017. In addition to evaluating different QPE sources, threshold types, and magnitudes, QPE accumulation interval lengths from hourly to daily are considered. Systematic errors with QPE sources are identified, including a radar distance dependence on extreme rainfall frequency in MRMS, spurious occurrences of locally extreme precipitation in the complex terrain of the West in ST4, and insufficient QPEs for many legitimate heavy precipitation events in CCPA. Overall, flash flood warnings and reports corresponded to each other far more than any QPE exceedances. Correspondence between all sources was at a maximum in the East and worst in the West, with ST4, CCPA, and MRMS QPE exceedances locally yielding maximal correspondence in the East, Plains, and West, respectively. Surprisingly, using a fixed 2.5 in. (24 h)−1 proxy outperformed shorter accumulation exceedances and the use of ARIs and FFGs. On regional scales, different ARI exceedances achieved superior performance to the selection of any fixed threshold; FFG exceedances were consistently too rare to achieve optimal correspondence with observed flash flooding.},

	volume = {17},
	doi = {10.3390/rs17081393},
	abstract = {Flash floods, typically triggered by natural events such as heavy rainfall, snowmelt, and dam failures, are characterized by abrupt onset, destructive power, unpredictability, and challenges in mitigation. This study investigates the spatial distribution patterns and driving mechanisms of rainstorm-induced flash flood disasters in the Yarlung Tsangpo River Basin (YTRB) by integrating topography, hydrometeorology, human activity data, and historical disaster records. Through a multi-method spatial analysis framework—including kernel density estimation, standard deviation ellipse, spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s I and Getis–Ord Gi*), and the optimal parameter geographic detector (OPGD) model (integrating univariate analysis and interaction detection)—we reveal multiscale disaster dynamics across county, township, and small catchment levels. Key findings indicate that finer spatial resolution (e.g., small catchment scale) enhances precision when identifying high-risk zones. Temporally, the number of rainstorm-induced flash floods increased significantly and disaster-affected areas expanded significantly from the 1980s to the 2010s, with a peak spatial dispersion observed during 2010–2019, reflecting a westward shift in disaster distribution. Spatial aggregation of flash floods persisted throughout the study period, concentrated in the central basin. Village density (TD) was identified as the predominant human activity factor, exhibiting nonlinear amplification through interactions with short-duration heavy rainfall (particularly 3 h [P3] and 6 h [P6] maximum precipitations) and GDP. These precipitation durations demonstrated compounding risk effects, where sustained rainfall intensity progressively heightened disaster potential. Topographic and ecological interactions, particularly between elevation (DEM) and vegetation type (VT), further modulate disaster intensity. These findings provide critical insights for risk zonation and targeted prevention strategies in high-altitude river basins.},

	abstract = {A prototype hydrometeorological model for real-time, site-specific, flash flood prediction is presented. Precipitation prediction components are coupled with runoff-generating and flood-routing components through the water mass conservation law and a state estimator which was used for updating the model state variables from real-time observations. The model is capable of operating under the various data availability conditions existing in flash flood prone areas. Sensitivity analysis using data from significant past flash floods indicates that short-term model predictions are not significantly sensitive to the runoff-generating model component when updating is performed. In addition, the sensitivity analysis suggested that model performance is best when all available meteorological and hydrological data are utilized by the state estimator. Remarkably (given the data available for calibration) good predictions of stream stage were obtained by the model for several flash flood cases.},

Then we show how ANNs allow other variables to be easily added, like peak rainfall intensity, with a further performance improvement (TSS=0.66). This may stimulate more research on the use of this powerful tool for deriving landslide early warning thresholds.},

	abstract = {Floods in the Mediterranean region are often surface water floods, in which intense precipitation is usually the main driver. Determining the link between the causes and impacts of floods can make it easier to calculate the level of flood risk. However, up until now, the limitations in quantitative observations for flood-related damages have been a major obstacle when attempting to analyse flood risk in the Mediterranean. Flood-related insurance damage claims for the last 20 years could provide a proxy for flood impact, and this information is now available in the Mediterranean region of Catalonia, in northeast Spain. This means a comprehensive analysis of the links between flood drivers and impacts is now possible. The objective of this paper is to develop and evaluate a methodology to estimate flood damages from heavy precipitation in a Mediterranean region. Results show that our model is able to simulate the probability of a damaging event as a function of precipitation. The relationship between precipitation and damage provides insights into flood risk in the Mediterranean and is also promising for supporting flood management strategies.},

	abstract = {The anticipation of flash flood events is crucial to issue warnings to mitigate their impact. This work presents a comparison of two early warning systems for real-time flash flood hazard forecasting at regional scale. The two systems are based in a gridded drainage network and they use weather radar precipitation inputs to assess the hazard level in different points of the study area, considering the return period (in years) as the indicator of the flash flood hazard. The essential difference between the systems is that one is a rainfall-based system (ERICHA), using the upstream basin-aggregated rainfall as the variable to determine the hazard level, while the other (Flood-PROOFS) is a system based on a distributed rainfall-runoff model to compute the streamflows at pixel scale. The comparison has been done for three rainfall events in the autumn of 2014 that resulted in severe flooding in the Liguria region (Northwest of Italy). The results obtained by the two systems show many similarities, particularly for larger catchments and for large return periods (extreme floods).},

Expert elicitation refers to formal procedures for obtaining and combining expert judgments. Expert elicitation is required when existing data and models cannot provide needed information. This makes validating expert judgments a challenge because they are used when other data do not exist and thus measuring their accuracy is difficult. This article examines the classical model of structured expert judgment, which is an elicitation method that includes validation of the experts’ assessments against empirical data. In the classical model, experts assess both the unknown target questions and a set of calibration questions, which are items from the experts’ field that have observed true values. The classical model scores experts on their performance in assessing the calibration questions and then produces performance-weighted combinations of the experts. From 2006 through March 2015, the classical model has been used in thirty-three unique applications. Less than one-third of the individual experts in these studies were statistically accurate, highlighting the need for validation. Overall, the performance-based combination of experts produced in the classical model is more statistically accurate and more informative than an equal weighting of experts.},

In the UK such events are comparatively rare occurring on average only once or twice per year. Warning systems must depend upon the accurate real-time provision of rainfall information, high-resolution numerical weather forecasts and the operation of hydrological model systems in addition to forecast delivery procedures not discussed in this paper. In this paper we review how flash floods are forecast considering the limitations and uncertainty involved in both the meteorological and hydrological aspects of forecasting systems. Data assimilation and the use of ensembles are both key elements across disciplines. Assessing the susceptibility of river catchments to extreme flooding is considered, and statistical methods of estimating the likelihood of extreme rainfall and floods within a changing climate are examined. Ways of constraining flash flood forecasts are noted as one way to improve forecast performance in the future.},

	abstract = {Convection-permitting models (CPMs) have provided weather forecasting centres with a step-change in capabilities for forecasting rainfall. They are now used operationally to forecast precipitation in many parts of the world, including the UK. CPMs are models in which the dynamics of atmospheric convection is treated with sufficient accuracy in order to make it viable to switch off convection parametrization. This review describes the current state-of-the-art in operational CPM-based numerical weather prediction (NWP), primarily within the UK, and the historical development of CPMs. The characteristics of CPM systems and forecasts are highlighted and placed in an international context to recognize similar trends and highlight some differences. It is shown that the realism of CPM-based forecasts can provide improved subjective guidance on convection, and, when measured on appropriate scales, can improve rainfall forecasting skill compared to coarser-resolution NWP. Data assimilation techniques used with operational CPMs are reviewed and given historical context. Examples of new types of observations that may increase the skill of forecasts from improved initial conditions are discussed. CPM-based nowcasting systems are shown to provide considerable improvements in short-range forecasts of rapidly developing, intense systems. As a result, these CPM-based systems provide a new forecasting capability. Finally, the development of CPMs has also required new techniques to verify forecasts and define their skill. These have revealed that the lack of predictability of the smallest scales involving convection means that ensemble techniques are required to represent forecast uncertainty, resulting in a new capability to provide objective forecast probabilities of local precipitation.},

	abstract = {Flash floods are different from common floods because they occur rapidly over short time scales, and they are considered to be one of the most devastating natural hazards worldwide. Mountainous areas with high population densities are particularly threatened by flash floods because steep slopes generate high flow velocities. Therefore, there is a great need to develop an operational forecasting system (OFS) for better flash flood prediction and warning in mountainous regions. This study developed an OFS through the integration of meteorological, hydrological, and hydrodynamic models. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data were used to generate a digital elevation model (DEM). The OFS employs high-density and high-accuracy airborne LiDAR DEM data to simulate rapid water level rises and flooding as the result of intense rainfall within relatively small watersheds. The water levels and flood extent derived from the OFS are in agreement with the measured and surveyed data. The OFS has been adopted by the National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR) for forecasting flash floods every six hours in a mountainous floodplain in Taiwan. The 1D and 2D visualization of the OFS is performed via the National Center for Atmospheric Research Command Language (NCL).},

	abstract = {What is the best way to communicate the risk of rare but extreme weather to the public? One suggestion is to communicate the relative risk of extreme weather in the form of odds ratios; but, to the authors’ knowledge, this suggestion has never been tested systematically. The experiment reported here provides an empirical test of this hypothesis. Participants performed a realistic computer simulation task in which they assumed the role of the manager of a road maintenance company and used forecast information to decide whether to take precautionary action to prevent icy conditions on a town’s roads. Participants with forecasts expressed as odds ratios were more likely to take appropriate precautionary action on a single target trial with an extreme low temperature forecast than participants using deterministic or probabilistic forecasts. However, participants using probabilistic forecasts performed better on trials involving weather within the normal range than participants with only deterministic forecast information. These results may provide insight into how best to communicate extreme weather risk. This paper offers clear evidence that people given relative risk information are more inclined to take precautionary action when threatened with an extreme weather event with a low probability than people given only single-value or probabilistic forecasts.},

	abstract = {An experiment has been designed to evaluate and compare precipitation forecasts from a 5-member, 4-km grid-spacing (ENS4) and a 15-member, 20-km grid-spacing (ENS20) Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model ensemble, which cover a similar domain over the central United States. The ensemble forecasts are initialized at 2100 UTC on 23 different dates and cover forecast lead times up to 33 h. Previous work has demonstrated that simulations using convection-allowing resolution (CAR; dx ∼ 4 km) have a better representation of the spatial and temporal statistical properties of convective precipitation than coarser models using convective parameterizations. In addition, higher resolution should lead to greater ensemble spread as smaller scales of motion are resolved. Thus, CAR ensembles should provide more accurate and reliable probabilistic forecasts than parameterized-convection resolution (PCR) ensembles. Computation of various precipitation skill metrics for probabilistic and deterministic forecasts reveals that ENS4 generally provides more accurate precipitation forecasts than ENS20, with the differences tending to be statistically significant for precipitation thresholds above 0.25 in. at forecast lead times of 9–21 h (0600–1800 UTC) for all accumulation intervals analyzed (1, 3, and 6 h). In addition, an analysis of rank histograms and statistical consistency reveals that faster error growth in ENS4 eventually leads to more reliable precipitation forecasts in ENS4 than in ENS20. For the cases examined, these results imply that the skill gained by increasing to CAR outweighs the skill lost by decreasing the ensemble size. Thus, when computational capabilities become available, it will be highly desirable to increase the ensemble resolution from PCR to CAR, even if the size of the ensemble has to be reduced.},

While many machine learning methods are not new, university classes on machine learning are largely unavailable to meteorology students and are not required to become a meteorologist. The lack of formal instruction has contributed to perception that machine learning methods are “black boxes” and thus end-users are hesitant to apply the machine learning methods in their everyday workflow. To reduce the opaqueness of machine learning methods and lower hesitancy toward machine learning in meteorology, this paper provides a survey of some of the most common machine learning methods. A familiar meteorological example is used to contextualize the machine learning methods while also discussing machine learning topics using plain language. The following machine learning methods are demonstrated: linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosted decision trees, naïve Bayes, and support vector machines. Beyond discussing the different methods, the paper also contains discussions on the general machine learning process as well as best practices to enable readers to apply machine learning to their own datasets. Furthermore, all code (in the form of Jupyter notebooks and Google Colaboratory notebooks) used to make the examples in the paper is provided in an effort to catalyze the use of machine learning in meteorology.},

	abstract = {Both the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) are regularly employed in model evaluation studies. Willmott and Matsuura (2005) have suggested that the RMSE is not a good indicator of average model performance and might be a misleading indicator of average error, and thus the MAE would be a better metric for that purpose. While some concerns over using RMSE raised by Willmott and Matsuura (2005) and Willmott et al. (2009) are valid, the proposed avoidance of RMSE in favor of MAE is not the solution. Citing the aforementioned papers, many researchers chose MAE over RMSE to present their model evaluation statistics when presenting or adding the RMSE measures could be more beneficial. In this technical note, we demonstrate that the RMSE is not ambiguous in its meaning, contrary to what was claimed by Willmott et al. (2009). The RMSE is more appropriate to represent model performance than the MAE when the error distribution is expected to be Gaussian. In addition, we show that the RMSE satisfies the triangle inequality requirement for a distance metric, whereas Willmott et al. (2009) indicated that the sums-of-squares-based statistics do not satisfy this rule. In the end, we discussed some circumstances where using the RMSE will be more beneficial. However, we do not contend that the RMSE is superior over the MAE. Instead, a combination of metrics, including but certainly not limited to RMSEs and MAEs, are often required to assess model performance.},

An object-oriented verification process was developed to validate experimental HRRR convective precipitation forecasts during the 2013 warm season using the NCEP Stage IV multisensor precipitation product. A database of 467 convective precipitation features that were observed during the forecast assimilation period and their corresponding HRRR forecast precipitation features was created. This database was used to evaluate model performance over the entire forecast period, and to relate that performance to model processes, especially those related to precipitation production. Generally, HRRR precipitation is located within 30 km of the observed throughout the forecast period.

	abstract = {Calibrated high-temporal-resolution precipitation forecasts are desirable for a range of applications, for example, flood prediction in fast-rising rivers. However, high-temporal-resolution precipitation observations may not be available to support the establishment of calibration methods, particularly in regions with low population density or in developing countries. We present a new method to produce calibrated hourly precipitation ensemble forecasts from daily observations. Precipitation forecasts are taken from a high-resolution convective-scale numerical weather prediction (NWP) model run at the hourly time step. We conduct three experiments to develop the new calibration method: (i) calibrate daily precipitation totals and disaggregate daily forecasts to hourly; (ii) generate pseudohourly observations from daily precipitation observations, and use these to calibrate hourly precipitation forecasts; and (iii) combine aspects of (i) and (ii). In all experiments, we use the existing Bayesian joint probability model to calibrate the forecasts and the well-known Schaake shuffle technique to instill realistic spatial and temporal correlations in the ensembles. As hourly observations are not available, we use hourly patterns from the NWP as the template for the Schaake shuffle. The daily member matching method (DMM), method (iii), produces the best-performing ensemble precipitation forecasts over a range of metrics for forecast accuracy, bias, and reliability. The DMM method performs very similarly to the ideal case where hourly observations are available to calibrate forecasts. Overall, valuable spatial and temporal information from the forecast can be extracted for calibration with daily data, with a slight trade-off between forecast bias and reliability.},

These events affect very localized areas in space, recording high pluviometric accumulations in short time intervals. In this context, with the present study, we aim to analyze the extreme meteorological event that occurred in the northwestern and eastern parts of Sicily on 15 July 2020, by using the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model. In particular, during the afternoon, several storms affected those areas, causing intense precipitation, with maximum rainfall concentrated on the city of Palermo and in the Etna area. The rainfall at the end of the event reached 134 mm in Palermo and 49 mm in Catania, recorded by the Sicilian network meteorological stations. Because the event at Palermo was strongly localized, the analyses have been carried out by employing different sets of numerical simulations, by means of the WRF model, with horizontal spatial grid resolutions of 9, 3, and 1 km. Furthermore, the output of the performed simulation has been used to assess the thermodynamic profile and atmospheric instability indices. It allowed us to check the adopted parameters against those usually implemented in the flash flood scenario. By using the finest grid resolutions (3 and 1 km), the WRF model was able to provide more accurate predictions of the rainfall accumulation, even if they were strongly localized. Conversely, the implementation of less-refined spatial domain (9 km) did not allow us to obtain predictive estimates of precipitation.},

Heavy precipitation in the region has a large societal impact, causing flash floods. This motivates the forecast performance evaluation of 24-h accumulated precipitation and vertical profiles of atmospheric variables from different numerical weather prediction (NWP) models with the final aim of helping water management in the region. The NWP models evaluated include the Global Forecast System (GFS), which parameterizes convection, and convection-permitting simulations of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model configured by three institutions: University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (UIUC), Colorado State University (CSU), and National Meteorological Service of Argentina (SMN). These models were verified with daily accumulated precipitation data from rain gauges and soundings during the RELAMPAGO-CACTI field campaign. Generally all configurations of the higher-resolution WRFs outperformed the lower-resolution GFS based on multiple metrics. Among the convection-permitting WRF Models, results varied with respect to rainfall threshold and forecast lead time, but the WRFUIUC mostly performed the best. However, elevation-dependent biases existed among the models that may impact the use of the data for different applications. There is a dry (moist) bias in lower (upper) pressure levels which is most pronounced in the GFS. For Córdoba an overestimation of the northern flow forecasted by the NWP configurations at lower levels was encountered. These results show the importance of convection-permitting forecasts in this region, which should be complementary to the coarser-resolution global model forecasts to help various users and decision-makers.],},

For weather and river forecast offices, this is a pressing question given a likely future of increasing high-impact storm events.

Currently, communication of flood potential is accomplished through a suite of forecast and warning products, including river hydrographs, precipitation forecasts, and flood watches and warnings. Despite advances in forecast accuracy and lead time, people fail to respond to warnings and often suffer substantial damages and loss of property. To understand how the public uses and interprets National Weather Service (NWS) flood products, an extreme storm scenario was presented using NWS forecast products in a series of focus groups in the Delaware River basin (Pennsylvania–New Jersey). Findings from the sessions informed revisions of the products to which participants reported increased understanding and motivation to take action. Participants demonstrated a strong preference for river-level information presented through the NWS hydrograph among all the NWS products shown depicting an approaching hurricane. Simplified graphics, explanations in general terms, intuitive colors, and geographic specificity are key recommendations to improve comprehension of risk and uncertainty. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NWS are taking steps to operationalize some of these suggestions.

	abstract = {Convection-permitting ensemble prediction systems (CP-ENS) have been implemented in the midlatitudes for weather forecasting time scales over the past decade, enabled by the increase in computational resources. Recently, efforts are being made to study the benefits of CP-ENS for tropical regions. This study examines CP-ENS forecasts produced by the Met Office over tropical East Africa, for 24 cases in the period April–May 2019. The CP-ENS, an ensemble with parameterized convection (Glob-ENS), and their deterministic counterparts are evaluated against rainfall estimates derived from satellite observations (GPM-IMERG). The CP configurations have the best representation of the diurnal cycle, although heavy rainfall amounts are overestimated compared to observations. Pairwise comparisons between the different configurations reveal that the CP-ENS is generally the most skillful forecast for both 3- and 24-h accumulations of heavy rainfall (97th percentile), followed by the CP deterministic forecast. More precisely, probabilistic forecasts of heavy rainfall, verified using a neighborhood approach, show that the CP-ENS is skillful at scales greater than 100 km, significantly better than the Glob-ENS, although not as good as found in the midlatitudes. Skill decreases with lead time and varies diurnally, especially for CP forecasts. The CP-ENS is underspread both in terms of forecasting the locations of heavy rainfall and in terms of domain-averaged rainfall. This study demonstrates potential benefits in using CP-ENS for operational forecasting of heavy rainfall over tropical Africa and gives specific suggestions for further research and development, including probabilistic forecast guidance.},

To tackle the risks associated with flood disasters, there is a need to think beyond structural interventions for flood protection and move to more non-structural ones, such as flood early warning systems (FEWSs). Firstly, this study aimed to uncover how flood forecasting models in the FEWSs have evolved over the past three decades, 1993 to 2023, and to identify challenges and unearth opportunities to assist in model selection for flood prediction. Secondly, the study aimed to assist in model selection and, in return, point to the data and other modelling components required to develop an operational flood early warning system with a focus on data-scarce regions. The scoping literature review (SLR) was carried out through a standardised procedure known as Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The SLR was conducted using the electronic databases Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) from 1993 until 2023. The results of the SLR found that between 1993 and 2010, time series models (TSMs) were the most dominant models in flood prediction and machine learning (ML) models, mostly artificial neural networks (ANNs), have been the most dominant models from 2011 to present. Additionally, the study found that coupling hydrological, hydraulic, and artificial neural networks (ANN) is the most used ensemble for flooding forecasting in FEWSs due to superior accuracy and ability to bring out uncertainties in the system. The study recognised that there is a challenge of ungauged and poorly gauged rainfall stations in developing countries. This leads to data-scarce situations where ML algorithms like ANNs are required to predict floods. On the other hand, there are opportunities to use Satellite Precipitation Products (SPP) to replace missing or poorly gauged rainfall stations. Finally, the study recommended that interdisciplinary, institutional, and multisectoral collaborations be embraced to bridge this gap so that knowledge is shared for a faster-paced advancement of flood early warning systems.},

Ante vientos intensos previstos para el día siguiente, ¿qué nivel de aviso por vientos fuertes conviene emitir y en qué zonas? ¿A partir de qué altura cuajará la nieve en Galicia y qué espesor alcanzará? Este tipo de preguntas forman parte del día a día de los predictores, que han de aprender a convivir con las dudas, afrontarlas y tomar decisiones, a menudo en cortos intervalos de tiempo.},

	title = {Ensemble forecasting and the need for calibration},
	abstract = {Numerical weather prediction has seen, in the past 25 years, a shift from a ‘deterministic’ approach, based on single numerical integrations, to a probabilistic one, with ensembles of numerical integrations used to estimate the probability distribution function of forecast states. This shift to a probabilistic approach enabled a better extraction of predictive signals at longer lead times and provided a meaningful framework for extending the forecast length beyond 10 days. In this work, the limit of predictive skill is assessed for ECMWF monthly ensemble forecasts at different spatial and temporal scales. The forecast skill horizon is defined as the lead time when the ensemble ceases to be more skilful than a climatological distribution, using a continuous ranked probability score as metric. Results based on 32-day ensemble forecasts indicate that the forecast skill horizon is sensitive to the spatial and temporal scale of the predicted phenomena, to the variable considered and the area analysed. On average over 1 year of forecasts, the forecast skill horizon for instantaneous, grid-point fields is between 16 and 23 days, while it is considerably longer for time- and spatial-average fields. Forecast skill horizons longer than the 2 weeks that were thought to be the limit are now achievable thanks to major advances in numerical weather prediction. More specifically, they are possible because forecasts are now framed in probabilistic terms, with a probability distribution estimated using ensembles generated using forecast models that include more components (e.g. a dynamical ocean and ocean waves) and more faithfully represent processes. Moreover, the forecasts start from more accurate initial conditions constructed using better data-assimilation methods and more observational data.},

Additionally, the uptake of warnings may be hampered by difficulties in translating the scientific information to the local context and experiences. Here we use social science methods to characterise local knowledge of flash flooding among vulnerable communities along the flat Lake Malawi shoreline in the district of Karonga, northern Malawi. This is then used to guide a scientific analysis of the factors that contribute to flash floods in the area using contemporary global datasets, including geomorphology, soil and land-use characteristics, and hydro-meteorological conditions. Our results show that communities interviewed have detailed knowledge of the impacts and drivers of flash floods (deforestation and sedimentation), early warning signs (changes in clouds, wind direction, and rainfall patterns), and distinct hydro-meteorological processes that lead to flash flood events at the beginning and end of the wet season. Our analysis shows that the scientific data corroborate this knowledge and that combining local and scientific knowledge provides improved understanding of flash flood processes within the local context. We highlight the potential of linking large-scale global datasets with local knowledge to improve the usability of flash flood warnings.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.102897},
	abstract = {Social vulnerability is a key component of the risk equation alongside the context of the hazard and exposure. Increasingly, social vulnerability indices are used to better understand and predict the consequences of disasters, and support the development of improved disaster management policies. Humanitarian organisations particularly strive to capture social vulnerability in their decision processes relative to prioritisation of actions before disasters occur. This research supports the Ecuadorian Red Cross in generating a flood-specific social vulnerability index to inform flash flood early action at the Parroquia level in Ecuador. This paper compares the results from the two most common approaches used to create composite indices, one using the weighting of variables from disaster experts’ judgments (referred to as Expert method) and the other using PCA analysis, with one or more components. While all outcomes reveal similar trends in areas where most indicators suggest the lowest (urban areas) or highest (the Amazon and northwest coastal regions) social vulnerability, the research shows that the choice of the method matters for assessing the social vulnerability in the rest of the country where there are less pronounced vulnerability signals. In those areas, PCA-driven indices suggest higher relative vulnerability levels than Expert outcomes. Further, in the Andes particularly, the PCA outcomes result in wider distribution than the Expert outcomes, and therefore more heterogeneity in the vulnerability assessment. While divergence in outcomes suggests particular attention with the use of composite indexes for decision making, our results provide support to understand the sensitivity in flood-specific social vulnerability outcomes spatially. To go further we emphasise the importance of using historical flood impact data to evaluate the contribution of each variable in the final social vulnerability scores.},

	abstract = {Predictions of floods, droughts, and fast drought-flood transitions are required at different time scales to develop management strategies targeted at minimizing negative societal and economic impacts. Forecasts at daily and seasonal scale are vital for early warning, estimation of event frequency for hydraulic design, and long-term projections for developing adaptation strategies to future conditions. All three types of predictions—forecasts, frequency estimates, and projections—typically treat droughts and floods independently, even though both types of extremes can be studied using related approaches and have similar challenges. In this review, we (a) identify challenges common to drought and flood prediction and their joint assessment and (b) discuss tractable approaches to tackle these challenges. We group challenges related to flood and drought prediction into four interrelated categories: data, process understanding, modeling and prediction, and human–water interactions. Data-related challenges include data availability and event definition. Process-related challenges include the multivariate and spatial characteristics of extremes, non-stationarities, and future changes in extremes. Modeling challenges arise in frequency analysis, stochastic, hydrological, earth system, and hydraulic modeling. Challenges with respect to human–water interactions lie in establishing links to impacts, representing human–water interactions, and science communication. We discuss potential ways of tackling these challenges including exploiting new data sources, studying droughts and floods in a joint framework, studying societal influences and compounding drivers, developing continuous stochastic models or non-stationary models, and obtaining stakeholder feedback. Tackling one or several of these challenges will improve flood and drought predictions and help to minimize the negative impacts of extreme events.},

This article presents a detailed analysis of the hydro-meteorological forcing and the hydrological consequences of this event. A specific approach, the “forensic hydrological analysis” was followed in order to include and combine retrospectively a variety of data from different disciplines. Such an approach investigates the origins, mechanisms and course of such natural events if possible in a “near real time” mode, in order to follow the most recent traces of the event. The results show that it was a very rare rainfall event with extreme intensities which, in combination with catchment properties, led to extreme runoff plus severe geomorphological hazards, i.e. great debris flows, which together resulted in immense damage in this small rural town Braunsbach. It was definitely a record-breaking event and greatly exceeded existing design guidelines for extreme flood discharge for this region, i.e. by a factor of about 10. Being such a rare or even unique event, it is not reliably feasible to put it into a crisp probabilistic context. However, one can conclude that a return period clearly above 100 years can be assigned for all event components: rainfall, peak discharge and sediment transport. Due to the complex and interacting processes, no single flood cause or reason for the very high damage can be identified, since only the interplay and the cascading characteristics of those led to such an event. The roles of different human activities on the origin and/or intensification of such an extreme event are finally discussed.},

This is especially true in the Sahel, an increasingly important zone in terms of disaster risk reduction. To what extent do small disasters cumulatively impart substantial losses in the Sahel and how do public and nonprofit decision-makers manage them? To answer these questions, we adopt a mixed methods approach. Analyzing state-level panel data on disasters losses in Senegal and Mali for the decade between 2005 and 2014, we find that small disasters impart as much if not more damage than big disasters and especially affect housing and agriculture. We find that large disasters are concentrated in southern Mali, indicating other areas mainly experiencing small disasters may be overlooked by assistance classically triggered by many deaths from a big event. We distill policy insights from these quantitative findings with ten qualitative interviews, three focus groups, and document analysis. The qualitative findings highlight the challenges of small disasters and the consequences of conflict alongside small disasters. Together, the findings suggest that small disasters lead to significant disruption for vulnerable communities already shouldering burdens of conflict, food insecurity, and environmental degradation.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a coupled observation and modelling strategy aiming at improving the understanding of processes triggering flash floods. This strategy is illustrated for the Mediterranean area using two French catchments (Gard and Ardèche) larger than 2000 km2. The approach is based on the monitoring of nested spatial scales: (1) the hillslope scale, where processes influencing the runoff generation and its concentration can be tackled; (2) the small to medium catchment scale (1–100 km2), where the impact of the network structure and of the spatial variability of rainfall, landscape and initial soil moisture can be quantified; (3) the larger scale (100–1000 km2), where the river routing and flooding processes become important. These observations are part of the HyMeX (HYdrological cycle in the Mediterranean EXperiment) enhanced observation period (EOP), which will last 4 years (2012–2015). In terms of hydrological modelling, the objective is to set up regional-scale models, while addressing small and generally ungauged catchments, which represent the scale of interest for flood risk assessment. Top-down and bottom-up approaches are combined and the models are used as "hypothesis testing" tools by coupling model development with data analyses in order to incrementally evaluate the validity of model hypotheses. The paper first presents the rationale behind the experimental set-up and the instrumentation itself. Second, we discuss the associated modelling strategy.

This paper describes the set-up of the system, and provides justification for the initial-condition and model perturbation schemes chosen.

In particular, in ensemble forecast verification, AUC provides a basis for the comparison of potential predictive skill of competing forecasts. While this approach is straightforward when dealing with forecasts of common events (e.g., probability of precipitation), the AUC interpretation can turn out to be oversimplistic or misleading when focusing on rare events (e.g., precipitation exceeding some warning criterion). How should we interpret AUC of ensemble forecasts when focusing on rare events? How can changes in the way probability forecasts are derived from the ensemble forecast affect AUC results? How can we detect a genuine improvement in terms of predictive skill? Based on verification experiments, a critical eye is cast on the AUC interpretation to answer these questions. As well as the traditional trapezoidal approximation and the well-known binormal fitting model, we discuss a new approach that embraces the concept of imprecise probabilities and relies on the subdivision of the lowest ensemble probability category.},

	doi = {10.1002/hyp.7111},
	abstract = {The monitoring of flash-flood events gives us the unique opportunity to observe how catchments respond when most of the surface and subsurface hydrologic flow paths are active. These events often reveal aspects of hydrological behaviour that either were unexpected on the basis of weaker responses or highlight anticipated but previously unobserved behaviour (Delrieu et al., 2005; Archer et al., 2007). Characterizing the response of a catchment during flash-flood events, thus, may provide new and valuable insight into the rate-limiting processes for extreme flood response and their dependency on catchment properties and flood severity. Flash-flood events, however, are difficult to monitor because they develop at space and time scales that conventional measurement networks of rain and river discharges are not able to sample effectively (Creutin and Borga, 2003). As these events are locally rare, they are also difficult to capture during classical field-based experimentation, designed to last a few months over a given region, or on experimental catchments with drainage areas of a few square kilometres. This explains why the investigation of flash-flood events is by necessity event-based and opportunistic as opposed to driven by observations from carefully designed field campaigns. Post-event surveys therefore play a critical role in gathering essential observations concerning flash floods. Traditionally, indirect peak discharge estimates and collection of rainfall maxima have been used to document these events, as well as to provide an answer to the questions that are invariably asked after a major flood: Why did such a major flood occur? How frequently can such a flood be expected to occur? Collectively, these studies contributed to the establishment of regional peak discharge envelope curves and to the development of a better understanding of regional behaviour of extreme floods. However, focus on peak discharges and point rainfall maxima alone provides limited insight into the hydrological controls of flash-flood response.},

Methods are reviewed for assessing whether floods may increase in the future. Accounting for feedbacks within the human‐water system is important when assessing flood changes over lead times of decades or centuries. It is argued that an integrated flood risk management approach is needed for dealing with future flood risk with a focus on reducing the vulnerability of the societal system},

Furthermore, these events are poorly quantified in projections of future climate change making adaptation to the risk of flash flooding problematic. Consequently, knowledge of the processes contributing to intense, short-duration rainfall is less complete compared with those on daily timescales. The INTENSE project is addressing this global challenge by undertaking a data collection initiative that is coupled with advances in high-resolution climate modelling to better understand key processes and likely future change. The project has so far acquired data from over 23 000 rain gauges for its global sub-daily rainfall dataset (GSDR) and has provided evidence of an intensification of hourly extremes over the US. Studies of these observations, combined with model simulations, will continue to advance our understanding of the role of local-scale thermodynamics and large-scale atmospheric circulation in the generation of these events and how these might change in the future.},

This type of scenario is relevant for predicting the risk of localized, intense rainfall events with a duration between 15 min and several hours. Such rainfall events can cause surface‐water (pluvial) flooding. Producing useful forecasts of these events at lead times of more than a few hours is challenging due to the precision and accuracy in rainfall intensity, duration and location that is required. The technique described here addresses these challenges by constructing appropriate scenarios using a neighbourhood technique in combination with ensemble forecasting. It is similar to the distance‐dependent depth–duration analysis described in earlier studies, but it introduces an additional post‐processing step based on probability distribution functions of rainfall accumulation near a location of interest. This additional step makes the reasonable worst‐case scenarios less dependent on grid‐scale behaviour, and helps to generate scenarios with a consistent interpretation. The method is used to compare forecasts with a lead time of 6–36 hr to radar data for several case studies that occurred in Yorkshire. These comparisons also introduce new techniques to present maps of the reasonable worst‐case rainfall accumulation at each location.},

	abstract = {Up to now, flash flood monitoring and forecasting systems, based on rainfall radar measurements and distributed rainfall–runoff models, generally aimed at estimating flood magnitudes – typically discharges or return periods – at selected river cross sections. The approach presented here goes one step further by proposing an integrated forecasting chain for the direct assessment of flash flood possible impacts on inhabited areas (number of buildings at risk in the presented case studies). The proposed approach includes, in addition to a distributed rainfall–runoff model, an automatic hydraulic method suited for the computation of flood extent maps on a dense river network and over large territories. The resulting catalogue of flood extent maps is then combined with land use data to build a flood impact curve for each considered river reach, i.e. the number of inundated buildings versus discharge. These curves are finally used to compute estimated impacts based on forecasted discharges. The approach has been extensively tested in the regions of Alès and Draguignan, located in the south of France, where well-documented major flash floods recently occurred. The article presents two types of validation results. First, the automatically computed flood extent maps and corresponding water levels are tested against rating curves at available river gauging stations as well as against local reference or observed flood extent maps. Second, a rich and comprehensive insurance claim database is used to evaluate the relevance of the estimated impacts for some recent major floods.},

	abstract = {A new diagnostic convective closure, which is dependent on convective available potential energy (CAPE), is derived under the quasi-equilibrium assumption for the free troposphere subject to boundary layer forcing. The closure involves a convective adjustment time scale for the free troposphere and a coupling coefficient between the free troposphere and the boundary layer based on different time scales over land and ocean. Earlier studies with the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) have already demonstrated the model’s ability to realistically represent tropical convectively coupled waves and synoptic variability with use of the “standard” CAPE closure, given realistic entrainment rates. A comparison of low-resolution seasonal integrations and high-resolution short-range forecasts against complementary satellite and radar data shows that with the extended CAPE closure it is also possible, independent of model resolution and time step, to realistically represent nonequilibrium convection such as the diurnal cycle of convection and the convection tied to advective boundary layers, although representing the late night convection over land remains a challenge. A more in-depth regional analysis of the diurnal cycle and the closure is provided for the continental United States and particularly Africa, including comparison with data from satellites and a cloud-resolving model (CRM). Consequences for global numerical weather prediction (NWP) are not only a better phase representation of convection, but also better forecasts of its spatial distribution and local intensity.},

In our paper, we present a methodology to assess the potential added value of early warning early action systems (EWEAS), and we explore the decision-makers’ dilemma between acting upon limited-quality forecast information and taking less effective actions. The assessment is carried out for i) an one- and ii) a two-stage action system, in which a first action that is based on a lower skill and longer lead time forecast may be followed up by a second action that is based on a short-term, higher-confidence forecast. Through an idealized case study, we demonstrate that a) that the optimal lead time to trigger action is a function of forecast quality, the local geographic conditions and the operational characteristics of the forecast-based actions and b) low-certainty, long lead time forecasts can become valuable when paired with short-term, higher quality ones in a two-stage action approach.},

In addition, studies that classify catchments according to their flood-driving mechanisms often identify a single mechanism per location, although multiple mechanisms typically contribute to flood risk. We introduce a new method that uses seasonality statistics to estimate the relative importance of extreme precipitation, soil moisture excess, and snowmelt as flood drivers. Applying this method to a European data set of maximum annual flow dates in several thousand catchments reveals that from 1960 to 2010 relatively few annual floods were caused by annual rainfall peaks. Instead, most European floods were caused by snowmelt and by the concurrence of heavy precipitation with high antecedent soil moisture. For most catchments, the relative importance of these mechanisms has not substantially changed during the past five decades. Exposing the regional mechanisms underlying Europe's most costly natural hazard is a key first step in identifying the processes that require most attention in future flood research.},

Within the last few years, a vast machine learning research community has emerged for creating new and tailor-made products, accelerating processing and – most of all – creating emulators for the entire production of global forecasts that outperform traditional systems at the spatial resolution of the training data. In this context, the role of both numerical models and observations is changing from being equation to data driven. Model simulations and reanalyses are becoming the new currency for training machine learning, and operational centres are in a powerful position as they generate these datasets based on decades worth of experience. This environment creates incredible opportunities to progress much faster than in the past but also uncertainties about what the strategic implications on defining cost-effective and sustainable research and operations are, and how to achieve sufficient high-performance computing and data handling capacities. It will take individual national public services a while to understand what to focus on and how to coordinate their substantial investments in staff and infrastructure at institutional, national and international level.

	abstract = {Ensemble weather forecasts often under-represent uncertainty, leading to overconfidence in their predictions. Multi-model forecasts combining several individual ensembles have been shown to display greater skill than single-ensemble forecasts in predicting temperatures, but tend to retain some bias in their joint predictions. Established postprocessing techniques are able to correct bias and calibration issues in univariate forecasts, but are generally not designed to handle multivariate forecasts (of several variables or at several locations, say). We propose a flexible multivariate Bayesian postprocessing framework, based on a directed acyclic graph representing the relationships between the ensembles and the observed weather. The posterior forecast is inferred from available ensemble forecasts and an estimate of the shared discrepancy, obtained from a collection of past forecast–observation pairs. We also propose a novel approach to selecting an appropriate training set for estimation of the required correction, using synoptic-scale analogues to obtain a regime-dependent estimate of the adjustment. The proposed technique is applied to forecasts of surface temperature over the UK during the winter period from 2007 to 2013. Although the resulting parametric multivariate-normal probabilistic forecasts are marginally less sharp than those of the leading competitor, they capture the spatial structure of the observations better than a correlation structure based on either the ensembles or climatology alone, and are robust to changes in the variables and spatial domain of the forecast, at a greatly reduced computational cost.},

To address these challenges, in 2013 the Hydrometeorological Testbed at the Weather Prediction Center (HMT-WPC), partnering with the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) and the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL), developed and hosted the inaugural Flash Flood and Intense Rainfall (FFaIR) Experiment. In its first two years, the experiment has focused on ways to combine meteorological guidance with available hydrologic information. One example of this is the creation of neighborhood flash flood guidance (FFG) exceedance probabilities, which combine QPF information from convection-allowing ensembles with flash flood guidance; these were found to provide valuable information about the flash flood threat across the contiguous United States. Additionally, WPC has begun to address the challenge of flash flood verification by developing a verification database that incorporates observations from a variety of disparate sources in an attempt to build a comprehensive picture of flash flooding across the nation. While the development of this database represents an important step forward in the verification of flash flood forecasts, many of the other challenges identified during the experiment will require a long-term community effort in order to make notable advancements.},

	abstract = {Statistical post-processing techniques are now used widely for correcting systematic biases and errors in the calibration of ensemble forecasts obtained from multiple runs of numerical weather prediction models. A standard approach is the ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) method, which results in a predictive distribution that is given by a single parametric law, with parameters that depend on the ensemble members. This article assesses the merits of combining multiple EMOS models based on different parametric families. In four case studies with wind speed and precipitation forecasts from two ensemble prediction systems, we investigate the performances of state of the art forecast combination methods and propose a computationally efficient approach for determining linear pool combination weights. We study the performance of forecast combination compared to that of the theoretically superior but cumbersome estimation of a full mixture model, and assess which degree of flexibility of the forecast combination approach yields the best practical results for post-processing applications.},

	abstract = {Since April 2007, the numerical weather prediction model, COSMO (Consortium for Small Scale Modelling), has been used operationally in a convection-permitting configuration, named COSMO-DE, at the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD; German weather service). Here the authors discuss the model changes that were necessary for the convective scale, and report on the experience from the first years of operational application of the model. For COSMO-DE the ability of the numerical solver to treat small-scale structures has been improved by using a Runge–Kutta method, which allows for the use of higher-order upwind advection schemes. The one-moment cloud microphysics parameterization has been extended by a graupel class, and adaptations for describing evaporation of rain and stratiform precipitation processes were made. Comparisons with a much more sophisticated two-moment scheme showed only minor differences in most cases with the exception of strong squall-line situations. Whereas the deep convection parameterization was switched off completely, small-scale shallow convection was still parameterized by the appropriate part of the Tiedtke scheme. During the first year of operational use, convective events in synoptically driven situations were satisfactorily simulated. Also the daily cycles of summertime 10-m wind and 1-h precipitation sums were well captured. However, it became evident that the boundary layer description had to be adapted to enhance convection initiation in airmass convection situations. Here the asymptotic Blackadar length scale l∞ had proven to be a sensitive parameter.},
