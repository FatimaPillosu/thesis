	abstract = {Flood hazards pose a significant threat to agricultural production. Agricultural adaptations tend to be prevalent and systematic in high-frequency flood (HFF) areas but neglected in low-frequency flood (LFF) areas. Here, using satellite imagery, we map global spatial distributions of LFF and HFF at 250 m resolution for 3,427 flood events between 2000 and 2021. We show that LFF affected a larger proportion of cropland area (4.7\%) than HFF (1.2\%), and HFF occurred in smaller regions with less intensity. Cropland expansion between 2000 and 2019 increased the area affected by LFF (3.1 × 104 km2) more than that affected by HFF (1.3 × 104 km2). Moreover, the mean yield losses of wheat and rice from LFF were greater than those from HFF, owing to the higher precipitation anomalies, soil moisture anomalies and greater crop flooding during their growing seasons. Our findings highlight the urgency of this issue and identify priority areas to prevent these neglected low-frequency but high-impact floods, providing valuable information for developing flood-adapted policy.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe effects of spatial variability of rainfall, geomorphology, and climatology of precipitation and temperature on the hydrologic response remain poorly understood. This study characterizes the catchment response in terms of a variable called flashiness, that describes the severity of the flood response as the rate of rise of the unit discharge. It overcomes limitations of prior works based on limited case studies or simulations by gathering information on basins of widely varying characteristics and by using a high-resolution rainfall and flooding event data set spanning 10 years over the Continental United States. The objective is to develop a robust understanding of how rainfall spatial variability influences flash flood severity and to assess its contribution relative to basin physiography and climatology. This study explores the first-order dependencies as well as the variability in these relationships and investigates the complex interactions using a multi-dimensional statistical modeling approach. The results confirm that the spatial organization of rainfall influences the basin response on par with geomorphology and climatology. Basin physiography dampens the effect of lower rainfall intensities, while higher rainfall overwhelms other factors and primarily contributes to flashiness. Dispersion of precipitation with respect to the flow path decreases flood severity. An improved understanding of sub-basin scale rainfall spatial variability aids in developing a robust flash flood severity index to identify and mitigate flash flooding situations as well as identifying basins which could most benefit from distributed hydrologic modeling.},

	doi = {10.1002/hyp.10893},
	abstract = {Water and energy fluxes at and between the land surface, the subsurface and the atmosphere are inextricably linked over all spatio-temporal scales. Our research focuses on the joint analysis of both water and energy fluxes in a pre-alpine catchment (55 km2) in southern Germany, which is part of the Terrestrial Environmental Observatories (TERENO). We use a novel three-dimensional, physically based and distributed modelling approach to reproduce both observed streamflow as an integral measure for water fluxes and heat flux and soil temperature measurements at an observation location over a period of 2 years. While heat fluxes are often used for comparison of the simulations of one-dimensional land surface models, they are rarely used for additional validation of physically based and distributed hydrological modelling approaches. The spatio-temporal variability of the water and energy balance components and their partitioning for dominant land use types of the study region are investigated. The model shows good performance for simulating daily streamflow (Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency {\textgreater} 0.75). Albeit only streamflow measurements are used for calibration, the simulations of hourly heat fluxes and soil temperatures at the observation site also show a good performance, particularly during summer. A limitation of the model is the simulation of temperature-driven heat fluxes during winter, when the soil is covered by snow. An analysis of the simulated spatial fields reveals heat flux patterns that reflect the distribution of the land use and soil types of the catchment. The water and energy partitioning is characterized by a strong seasonal cycle and shows clear differences between the selected land use types.

	abstract = {Process-based hydrological models have a long history dating back to the 1960s. Criticized by some as over-parameterized, overly complex, and difficult to use, a more nuanced view is that these tools are necessary in many situations and, in a certain class of problems, they are the most appropriate type of hydrological model. This is especially the case in situations where knowledge of flow paths or distributed state variables and/or preservation of physical constraints is important. Examples of this include: spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture, groundwater flow and runoff generation, sediment and contaminant transport, or when feedbacks among various Earth’s system processes or understanding the impacts of climate non-stationarity are of primary concern. These are situations where process-based models excel and other models are unverifiable. This article presents this pragmatic view in the context of existing literature to justify the approach where applicable and necessary. We review how improvements in data availability, computational resources and algorithms have made detailed hydrological simulations a reality. Avenues for the future of process-based hydrological models are presented suggesting their use as virtual laboratories, for design purposes, and with a powerful treatment of uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Flash floods are not only the deadliest weather-related hazard but also one of the leading challenges with which governments and societies need to cope. Flash floods occur within a very limited time, which is insufficient to enable effective warnings and preparedness. Flash floods have become, for many reasons, the most frequent form of natural disaster in Malaysia, considerably affecting humans, property, and the economy. Modeling flash flood phenomena in the tropics is challenging due to the high topographic and meteorological complexity of these regions. The uncertain definition boundary of the monsoon flood and the multidisciplinary nature of flash flood studies also increase the challenge of the reviewing process. In this study, a systematic methodology was developed to review flash floods in Malaysia by considering all the possible related issues. This study revealed a gap in the data analysis of flash floods and that related studies in Malaysia are still not highly developed. Accordingly, the creation of a comprehensive Malaysian flash flood dataset is recommended to advance flash flood studies, modeling, and forecasting. Rainfall analysis based on Global Precipitation Measurement and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission data of different intensities also confirmed the high variability of rainfall in Malaysia. The highest variability in the hourly-based rainfall dataset was observed in the central region. The information and findings presented here will be useful for interested hydrologists and decision-makers by enabling better water management. Additionally, the proposed recommendations for future research could pave the way for a better understanding of flash floods in Malaysia, and the method could be applied in different river basins worldwide.},

	abstract = {This study examines the spatiotemporal evolution of China’s flash flood disasters (FFDs) since 1949 and explores driving factors affecting the spatial distribution of historical FFDs. Records of more than 60000 FFDs are examined, and the centroid comparison method is used to reveal the spatiotemporal evolution of FFDs from 1951 to 2015. In particular, the geographical locations of the centroids, degrees of aggregation, and associated movement tendencies are examined to conduct a preliminary analysis of correlations between rainfall, population, and the spatiotemporal evolution of FFDs. Subsequently, using relevant data from 2000 to 2015, three factors relating to FFDs in natural watershed units include namely rainfall, human activity, and the environment of the Earth’s surface. The geographical detector method is then employed to explore the effect of these driving factors on the spatial distribution of FFDs. Analysis results show that displacement of the spatial distribution of FFDs since 1949 is correlated with variations in rainfall and population distribution. In addition, it is determined that the distribution of FFDs occurring between 2000 and 2015 have regional differentiation characteristics. However, the effect of rainfall on the distribution of FFDs is more significant than that of human activity or the environment of the Earth’s surface, but interactions occur between these latter two factors in disaster-formative environments. Furthermore, results also show that the driving factors of FFDs have significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. In China, regions at high risk of FFDs include the Sichuan-Chongqing ecological zone, the South China ecological zone, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, while regions with a low risk of FFDs include the Northwest China arid zone, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Inner Mongolian Plateau, and the Northeast China ecological zone. These findings support further studies investigating disaster-formative environments, facilitate FFD risk zoning, and provide a scientific basis for plans to effectively prevent and control FFDs.},

	abstract = {This study focused on producing flash flood hazard susceptibility maps (FFHSM) using frequency ratio (FR) and statistical index (SI) models in the Xiqu Gully (XQG) of Beijing, China. First, a total of 85 flash flood hazard locations (n = 85) were surveyed in the field and plotted using geographic information system (GIS) software. Based on the flash flood hazard locations, a flood hazard inventory map was built. Seventy percent (n = 60) of the flooding hazard locations were randomly selected for building the models. The remaining 30\% (n = 25) of the flooded hazard locations were used for validation. Considering that the XQG used to be a coal mining area, coalmine caves and subsidence caused by coal mining exist in this catchment, as well as many ground fissures. Thus, this study took the subsidence risk level into consideration for FFHSM. The ten conditioning parameters were elevation, slope, curvature, land use, geology, soil texture, subsidence risk area, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), and short-term heavy rain. This study also tested different classification schemes for the values for each conditional parameter and checked their impacts on the results. The accuracy of the FFHSM was validated using area under the curve (AUC) analysis. Classification accuracies were 86.61\%, 83.35\%, and 78.52\% using frequency ratio (FR)-natural breaks, statistical index (SI)-natural breaks and FR-manual classification schemes, respectively. Associated prediction accuracies were 83.69\%, 81.22\%, and 74.23\%, respectively. It was found that FR modeling using a natural breaks classification method was more appropriate for generating FFHSM for the Xiqu Gully.},

	abstract = {Flash flood is one of the most severe natural disasters around the world, and has caused sizeable economic losses and countless death. Assessing flash flood susceptibility by hybrid models of statistical and machine learning methods is essential for flood mitigation strategies and disaster preparedness. Although classifying the flash flood conditioning factors becomes a crucial step before applying these hybrid models, their impact on the accuracy of integrated modeling is still unclear. Most previous studies used natural break classification (NBC) and quantile classification methods by default to conduct the classification, but more classification methods have not been tried. In this context, this study introduced three clustering algorithms of K-Means, Expectation Maximization, and ISOMaximum likelihood algorithm (ISOMax) into the classification of factors, and compared them to NBC and quantile classification. To test the impact of classification methods on integrated modeling, these classification results were applied into the construction of three hybrid models (i.e., the integrating of frequency ratio with support vector machines, random forest, and bayesian-regularization neural networks). Then, the accuracy of these hybrid models was evaluated by using ROC curves and statistical indicators. The classification results show that the clustering intervals in the same factor varied with classification algorithms. It can be found from the model performance evaluation results that different classification algorithms will lead to discrepancies in accuracy of integrated modeling. Compared to NBC, the ISOMax allows a better fitting and prediction ability of hybrid models in this study. The application of clustering algorithm provides a new perspective for improving the accuracy of integrated modeling.},

	abstract = {Flash floods are an increasing concern, especially in regions with abrupt topography and small areas where floods are rapid and energy-filled. That is the case of the El Guamo stream basin located in Manizales, Colombia. It has been proposed a duration-independent rainfall threshold for flash floods in this basin, using a hydrodynamic method that links critical water stages to cumulative rainfall. This paper presents a systematic literature review of 19 case studies from 2016 to 2021 to compare and highlight complexities and differences in the methods used in rainfall threshold estimation in both the El Guamo stream basin as in other case studies. The results identified four types of methods: i) empirical, ii) hydrological/hydrodynamic, iii) probabilistic, and iv) compound. Each method identified the principal indicators and their predictor variables. Each method uses different indicators, such as accumulated rain, accumulated antecedent rainfall, intensity-duration of the rain event, maximum cumulative or cumulative rainfall depth for a specific duration, and critical rainfall within given time periods. Scenario analysis of the predictor variables is a common approach used in rainfall threshold estimation. Some predicting variables found are antecedent moisture conditions, inundation criteria, and synthetic hyetographs. Some case studies include a probabilistic analysis of the predictor variables. This article concludes that indicators and their predicting variables can be adjusted to local flood early warning systems depending on the rainfall threshold method selected. Hydrodynamic models are solid in rainfall threshold estimation. However, it is highly advisable to include uncertainty analysis and new data sources to have more robust rainfall thresholds. Furthermore, probabilistic methods, including uncertainty analysis with utility functions, are a valuable tool to improve decision-making in early warning systems, which can help to refine the rainfall threshold estimation.},

QPEs from three different sources—NCEP Stage IV Precipitation Analysis (ST4), Climatology Calibrated Precipitation Analysis (CCPA), and Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) QPE—are evaluated across the United States from January 2015 to June 2017. In addition to evaluating different QPE sources, threshold types, and magnitudes, QPE accumulation interval lengths from hourly to daily are considered. Systematic errors with QPE sources are identified, including a radar distance dependence on extreme rainfall frequency in MRMS, spurious occurrences of locally extreme precipitation in the complex terrain of the West in ST4, and insufficient QPEs for many legitimate heavy precipitation events in CCPA. Overall, flash flood warnings and reports corresponded to each other far more than any QPE exceedances. Correspondence between all sources was at a maximum in the East and worst in the West, with ST4, CCPA, and MRMS QPE exceedances locally yielding maximal correspondence in the East, Plains, and West, respectively. Surprisingly, using a fixed 2.5 in. (24 h)−1 proxy outperformed shorter accumulation exceedances and the use of ARIs and FFGs. On regional scales, different ARI exceedances achieved superior performance to the selection of any fixed threshold; FFG exceedances were consistently too rare to achieve optimal correspondence with observed flash flooding.},

These heavy rainfalls caused flash floods and affected most geographic regions of the conterminous United States. Heavy rains associated with weather systems of tropical origin were not considered. Analyses of surface and standard level upper-air data were undertaken to identify and define important synoptic and mesoscale mechanisms that act to intensify and focus precipitation events over specific regions. These analyses indicated that three basic meteorological patterns were associated with flash flooding in the central and eastern United States. Heavy convective precipitation episodes that occurred in the West were considered as a separate category event. Climatological characteristics, composite analyses, and upper-air data are presented for these four classifications of events. The large variability of associated meteorological patterns and parameters (especially winds aloft) makes identification of necessary conditions for flash flood-producing rainfall quite difficult; however, a number of features were common to many of the events. An advancing middle-level, short-wave trough often helped to trigger and focus thunderstorm activity. The storm areas were often located very near the mid-tropospheric, large-scale ridge position and occurred within normally benign surface pressure patterns. Many of the intense rainfalls occurred during nighttime hours. These elusive characteristics further complicate a difficult forecast problem.},

We present a novel benchmark, derived from extensive experiments across diverse datasets, to evaluate the performance gains from class-balanced losses in GBDT models. Our findings establish the efficacy of these loss functions in enhancing model performance under class imbalance, providing actionable insights for practitioners tackling real-world imbalanced data challenges.

	abstract = {A landslide is a type of geological disaster that poses a threat to human lives and property. Landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA) is a crucial tool for landslide prevention. This paper’s primary objective is to compare the performances of conventional shallow machine learning methods and deep learning methods in LSA based on imbalanced data to evaluate the applicability of the two types of LSA models when class-weighted strategies are applied. In this article, logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), deep fully connected neural network (DFCNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks were employed for modeling in the Zigui-Badong area of the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China. Eighteen landslide influence factors were introduced to compare the performance of four models under a class balanced strategy versus a class imbalanced strategy. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) was applied for factor correlation analysis. The results reveal that the elevation and distance to rivers play a dominant role in LSA tasks. It was observed that DFCNN (AUC = 0.87, F1-score = 0.60) and LSTM (AUC = 0.89, F1-score = 0.61) significantly outperformed LR (AUC = 0.89, F1-score = 0.50) and RF (AUC = 0.88, F1-score = 0.50) under the class imbalanced strategy. The RF model achieved comparable outcomes (AUC = 0.90, F1-score = 0.61) to deep learning models under the class balanced strategy and ran at a faster training speed (up to 63 times faster than deep learning models). The LR model performance was inferior to that of the other three models under the balanced strategy. Meanwhile, the deep learning models and the shallow machine learning models showed significant differences in susceptibility spatial patterns. This paper’s findings will aid researchers in selecting appropriate LSA models. It is also valuable for land management policy making and disaster prevention and mitigation.},

If weather varies markedly within a gridbox, forecasts for specific sites inevitably fail. Here we present a statistical post-processing method for ensemble forecasts that accounts for the degree of variation within each gridbox, bias on the gridbox scale, and the weather dependence of each. When applying this post-processing, skill improves substantially across the globe; for extreme rainfall, for example, useful forecasts extend 5 days ahead, compared to less than 1 day without post-processing. Skill improvements are attributed to creation of huge calibration datasets by aggregating, globally rather than locally, forecast-observation differences wherever and whenever the observed “weather type” was similar. A strong focus on meteorological understanding also contributes. We suggest that applications for our methodology include improved flash flood warnings, physics-related insights into model weaknesses and global pointwise re-analyses.},

	abstract = {Flash flooding is a significant societal problem, but related precipitation forecasts are often poor. To address, one can try to use output from convection-parametrising (global) ensembles, post-processed to forecast at point-scale, or convection-resolving limited area ensembles. The new methodology described here combines both. We apply “ecPoint-rainfall” post-processing to the ECMWF global ensemble. Alongside we use 2.2 km COSMO LAM ensemble output (centred on Italy), and also post-process that, using a scale-selective neighbourhood approach to compensate for insufficient members and to preserve consistently forecast local details. The two resulting scale-compatible components then undergo lead-time-weighted blending, to create the final probabilistic 6 h rainfall forecasts. Product creation for forecasters, in this way, constituted the “Italy Flash Flood use case” within the EU-funded MISTRAL project; real-time delivery of open access products is ongoing. One year of verification shows that, of the five components (2 {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash} raw, 2 {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash} post-processed and blended), ecPoint is the most skilful. The post-processed COSMO ensemble adds most value to summer convective events in the evening, when the global model has an underprediction bias. In two typical heavy rainfall case studies we observed underestimation of the largest point totals in the raw ECMWF ensemble, and overestimation in the raw COSMO ensemble. However, ecPoint elevated the ECMWF maxima and highlighted best the most affected areas and merged products seemed to be the most skilful of all. Even though our LAM post-processing does not include (or arguably need) bias-correction, this study still provides a unique blueprint for successfully combining ensemble rainfall forecasts from global and LAM systems around the world. It also has important implications for forecast products as global ensembles move ever closer to having convection-permitting resolution.},

	abstract = {Surface water flooding (SWF) is a severe hazard associated with extreme convective rainfall, whose spatial and temporal sparsity belie the significant impacts it has on populations and infrastructure. Forecasting the intense convective rainfall that causes most SWF on the temporal and spatial scales required for effective flood forecasting remains extremely challenging. National-scale flood forecasts are currently issued for the UK and are well regarded amongst flood responders, but there is a need for complementary enhanced regional information. Here we present a novel SWF-forecasting method, FOREWARNS (Flood fOREcasts for Surface WAter at a RegioNal Scale), that aims to fill this gap in forecast provision. FOREWARNS compares reasonable worst-case rainfall from a neighbourhood-processed, convection-permitting ensemble forecast system against pre-simulated flood scenarios, issuing a categorical forecast of SWF severity. We report findings from a workshop structured around three historical flood events in Northern England, in which forecast users indicated they found the forecasts helpful and would use FOREWARNS to complement national guidance for action planning in advance of anticipated events. We also present results from objective verification of forecasts for 82 recorded flood events in Northern England from 2013–2022, as well as 725 daily forecasts spanning 2019–2022, using a combination of flood records and precipitation proxies. We demonstrate that FOREWARNS offers good skill in forecasting SWF risk, with high spatial hit rates and low temporal false alarm rates, confirming that user confidence is justified and that FOREWARNS would be suitable for meeting the user requirements of an enhanced operational forecast.},

	volume = {22},
	doi = {10.1002/met.1328},
	abstract = {Extreme rain storms are known for triggering devastating flash floods in various regions of Europe and particularly along the Mediterranean coasts. Despite recent notable advances in weather forecasting, most operational early warning systems for extreme rainstorms and flash floods are still based on rainfall measurements from rain gauges and weather radars, rather than on forecasts. As a result, warning lead times are bounded to a few hours and warnings are usually issued when the event is already taking place.
This work proposes a novel early warning system for heavy precipitation events in Europe, aimed at identifying forecasts of extreme rainfall accumulations over short durations and within small-size catchments prone to flash flooding. The system is based on the recently developed European Precipitation Index based on simulated Climatology (EPIC), which is calculated using COSMO-LEPS ensemble weather forecasts and subsequently fitted with gamma distributions at each time step of the forecast horizon. Probabilistic exceedence of warning thresholds is calculated and alert points are generated where potentially extreme events are detected. Comparison of daily runs over 22 months with observed rainstorm events and flash floods in Europe denotes a probability of detection up to 90\%, corresponding to 45 events correctly predicted, with average lead time of 32 h.

The enduring repercussions extend across individuals, animals, societies, ecosystems, and geographical locations. The consequences of disasters on public health are particularly pronounced, manifesting in a spectrum of medical outcomes. This review delves into the specific impact of floods on distinct age groups, scrutinizing the varying vulnerabilities within each demographic. Infants, young children, teenagers, adults, and the elderly encounter distinctive challenges during and post-flood events, encompassing respiratory ailments, waterborne diseases, infections, hunger, physical injuries, and psychological disorders. Floods not only compromise healthcare services but also precipitate shortages in medication and suboptimal treatment. Health issues resulting from floods exhibit divergence among neonates, infants, children, adolescents, and older individuals. The susceptibility to physical injuries, infections, respiratory disorders, healthcare disruptions, mental health issues, malnutrition, and waterborne diseases varies with the unique vulnerabilities of each age group. Disruptions to routine life disproportionately impact children and adolescents, whereas infants and older individuals exhibit heightened susceptibility. Extreme flood events pose the potential for fatalities, with the risk contingent on both the severity of the flood and the age group affected. Older adults, newborns, and infants face a higher likelihood of mortality attributable to flood-related causes. Mitigating the adverse health effects of floods necessitates robust disaster planning, improved infrastructure, and targeted health interventions tailored to the age-related vulnerabilities of the population.},

Natural disaster data and 38 case studies published from 2008 to 2018 were reviewed, and measures of association (Risk Ratio, Odds Ratio, and Incidence Rate Ratio) were extracted from the case studies for quantitative analysis. The findings of the review indicate that the SDGs lack of multifactorial disease and mental health risk factors, as well as water-borne disease indicators, misses critical health-associated impacts of floods and droughts. In particular, the narrow focus on suicide as an indicator of mental health overlooks how anxiety disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can also have severe consequences for those affected by disasters. Health must be included in resilience-building initiatives at the individual, community, and national levels. The findings of the study suggest that further implementation research of the Sendai Framework and disaster risk reduction (DRR) efforts can contribute to the development of the broadly framed concept of health resilience to meet the needs of people at risk in disasters.},

Understanding of the inter-relations between both geophysical processes and human drivers and human victims at multiple scales is required. Teleconnections mean that the global, the rural and the urban all affect one another. Across Africa, as in other continents, flooding may arise locally within built-up areas from debris blocking streams and from overflowing sewers. Nevertheless, many cities are flooded by major rivers that carry extreme flows of water from surrounding regions and even distant mountains. The causes and impacts of floods, human vulnerability, possibilities of risk reduction and political and management responsibilities vary from the household and community levels up to sub-continental hydrologic systems and the global climate system. Co-ordinated action must take account of the differing scales of flood problems ranging from those arising from highly localised thunderstorms to the huge flood flows on major rivers produced by tropical cyclones. Urban flood management needs local, regional or national action at appropriate scales, with communities dealing with problems entirely with their areas, local governments acting on issues that are totally within their boundaries and national governments or international river basin organizations dealing with problems across many administrations.},

	abstract = {Throughout the past decades, climate change has been one of the most complex global issues. Characterized by worldwide alterations in weather patterns, along with a concomitant increase in the temperature of the Earth, climate change will undoubtedly have significant effects on food security and food safety. Climate change engenders climate variability: significant variations in weather variables and their frequency. Both climate variability and climate change are thought to threaten the safety of the food supply chain through different pathways. One such pathway is the ability to exacerbate foodborne diseases by influencing the occurrence, persistence, virulence and, in some cases, toxicity of certain groups of disease-causing microorganisms. Food safety can also be compromised by various chemical hazards, such as pesticides, mycotoxins, and heavy metals. With changes in weather patterns, such as lower rainfall, higher air temperature, and higher frequency of extreme weather events among others, this translates to emerging food safety concerns. These include the shortage of safe water for irrigation of agricultural produce, greater use of pesticides due to pest resistance, increased difficulty in achieving a well-controlled cold chain resulting in temperature abuse, or the occurrence of flash floods, which cause runoff of chemical contaminants in natural water courses. Together, these can result in foodborne infection, intoxication, antimicrobial resistance, and long-term bioaccumulation of chemicals and heavy metals in the human body. Furthermore, severe climate variability can result in extreme weather events and natural calamities, which directly or indirectly impair food safety. This review discusses the causes and impacts of climate change and variability on existing and emerging food safety risks and also considers mitigation and adaptation strategies to address the global warming and climate change problem.},

	abstract = {Objective
To assess global, regional and national trends in the impact of floods from 1990 to 2022 and determine factors influencing flood-related deaths.

Methods
We used data on flood disasters from the International Disaster Database for 1990–2022 from 168 countries. We calculated the annual percentage change to estimate trends in the rates of people affected and killed by floods by study period, World Health Organization (WHO) region, country income level and flood type. We used multivariable logistic regression analysis to assess the factors associated with death from floods.

Findings
From 1990 to 2022, 4713 floods were recorded in 168 countries, which affected {\textgreater} 3.2 billion people, caused 218 353 deaths and were responsible for more than 1.3 trillion United States dollars of economic losses. The WHO Western Pacific Region had the most people affected by floods ({\textgreater} 2.0 billion), accounting for 63.19\% (2 024 599 380/3 203 944 965) of all affected populations. The South-East Asia Region had the most deaths (71 713, 32.84\%). The African and Eastern Mediterranean Regions had the highest number of people affected and killed by floods per 100 000 population in 2022. The odds of floods causing more than 50 deaths were significantly higher in low-income countries (adjusted odds ratio: 14.34; 95\% confidence interval: 7.46 to 30.04) compared with high-income countries. Numbers of people affected and mortality due to floods declined over time.

Conclusion
Despite the decreases in populations affected and deaths, floods still have a serious impact on people and economies globally, particularly in lower-income countries. Action is needed to improve disaster risk management and flood mitigation.},

However, the capability of different rainfall-threshold methods has been insufficiently evaluated and validated, and the influence of data limitations on the model performance still needs to be explored. In this work, we comprehensively evaluate and compare three rainfall-threshold methods (empirical, hydrological, and probabilistic) based on soil moisture conditions for flash flood warnings in two small mountainous catchments with different data features. Results show that all three methods obtain good accuracy (Hit Rate (HR) {\textgreater} 0.80, False Alarm Rate (FAR) {\textless} 0.20) in both catchments, indicating that rainfall threshold is an efficient warning approach for flash flood management. Especially, the hydrological method shows the best predictive performance, with the highest Critical Success Index (CSI) (0.61 and 0.41, respectively in the two study catchments) and the lowest FAR (0.07 and 0.12), suggesting it is the most appropriate method for catchments where the hydrological model can be properly calibrated. Empirical and probabilistic methods are not far behind, showing comparable performance (CSI = 0.53 and 0.53, respectively for the Qingxi River (QXH) catchment). Catchment data availability, which reflects the representativeness of the relevant flash flood process conditions, greatly impacts the forecasting and model application. The results of this work improve our understanding of the applicability and reliability of these methods under various conditions, and aid in selecting or establishing a robust rainfall-threshold method for flash flood warning under complex environments.},

	abstract = {Flash floods, as prevalent and destructive natural disasters, pose significant threats to societal and economic systems. This study developed a holistic framework for flash flood risk assessment that integrates machine learning with multi-criteria decision analysis, while incorporating novel explainable artificial intelligence techniques, and applied it to assess flash flood risk in the Rao River Basin, a representative flash flood-prone area within the Poyang Lake system. Three ensemble learning models were employed for the evaluation of flash flood hazard, with their performance assessed via classification evaluation metrics and the results interpreted through explainability analysis. Multi-criteria decision analysis was used to assign weights to vulnerability-related factors, supporting the analysis of vulnerability. By synthesizing hazard and vulnerability assessments, a spatially explicit flash flood risk map was developed. The results show that the boosting model outperforms the other models in terms of hazard prediction, achieving superior performance in key metrics such as the F1-score(0.935) and AUC (0.977). Factors such as drainage density andruggedness number were found to significantly influence hazard levels. The proportions of cropland and impervious land areas, along with the urbanization level, were identified as significant contributors to vulnerability. The moderate to high-risk areas in the basin are predominantly found in settlement clusters located within hilly terrain. The analysis of historical flash flood events revealed that 77.7\% of disaster events occurred in high-risk and very high-risk zones. Additionally, field surveys corroborated the reliability of the model outcomes. These findings offer insights into disaster prevention and management efforts in such regions.},

Recent efforts in hydrology have aimed at predicting water flow, floods, and quality, yet most methodologies overlook the influence of adjacent areas and lack advanced visualization for water level assessment. Our contribution is two-fold: firstly, we introduce a graph neural network model (LocalFLoodNet) equipped with a graph learning module to capture the interconnections of water systems and the connectivity between stations to predict future water levels. Secondly, we develop a simulation prototype offering visual insights for decision-making in disaster prevention and policy-making. This prototype visualizes predicted water levels and facilitates data analysis using decades of historical information. Focusing on the Greater Montreal Area (GMA), particularly Terrebonne, Quebec, Canada, we apply LocalFLoodNet and prototype to demonstrate a comprehensive method for assessing flood impacts. By utilizing a digital twin of Terrebonne, our simulation tool allows users to interactively modify the landscape and simulate various flood scenarios, thereby providing valuable insights into preventive strategies. This research aims to enhance water level prediction and evaluation of preventive measures, setting a benchmark for similar applications across different geographic areas.},

Local floodings and debris flows following exceptional downpours often come without any adequate warning and cause heavy tolls to the human society. This work proposes a novel flood alert system for small catchments prone to flash flooding, capable of monitoring a large portion of the European domain. Operational streamflow simulations are produced through distributed hydrological modeling of ensemble weather forecasts. A long-term reforecast dataset is run through the same hydrological model to derive coherent warning thresholds. These are compared with operational discharge ensembles in a threshold exceedance analysis to produce early warnings. A case study in the southern Switzerland is tested over a 17-month period and system skills are evaluated by means of different quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results from three different predictors derived from the streamflow ensemble are shown and compared, also by accounting for the persistence of lagged forecasts. Significant improvements in predicting discharge thresholds exceedance are achieved by fitting gamma probability distributions to the raw ensemble. Further discussion underlines the limits of predictability of extreme events in small catchments due to the comparatively coarse space–time resolution of current weather forecasts.},

	abstract = {Flood hazard maps at trans-national scale have potential for a large number of applications ranging from climate change studies, reinsurance products, aid to emergency operations for major flood crisis, among others. However, at continental scales, only few products are available, due to the difficulty of retrieving large consistent data sets. Moreover, these are produced at relatively coarse grid resolution, which limits their applications to qualitative assessments. At finer resolution, maps are often limited to country boundaries, due to limited data sharing at trans-national level. The creation of a European flood hazard map would currently imply a collection of scattered regional maps, often lacking mutual consistency due to the variety of adopted approaches and quality of the underlying input data. In this work, we derive a pan-European flood hazard map at 100 m resolution. The proposed approach is based on expanding a literature cascade model through a physically based approach. A combination of distributed hydrological and hydraulic models was set up for the European domain. Then, an observed meteorological data set is used to derive a long-term streamflow simulation and subsequently coherent design flood hydrographs for a return period of 100 years along the pan-European river network. Flood hydrographs are used to simulate areas at risk of flooding and output maps are merged into a pan-European flood hazard map. The quality of this map is evaluated for selected areas in Germany and United Kingdom against national/regional hazard maps. Despite inherent limitations and model resolution issues, simulated maps are in good agreement with reference maps (hit rate between 59\% and 78\%, critical success index between 43\% and 65\%), suggesting strong potential for a number of applications at the European scale.},

An efficient evaluation framework must be able to spot issues and limitations and provide feedback to the system developers. In regional systems, the expertise of analysts on duty is a major component of the daily evaluation. On the other hand, large scale systems need to be complemented with semi-automated tools to evaluate the quality of forecasts equitably in every part of their domain. This article presents the current status of the monitoring and evaluation framework of the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS). For each grid point of the European river network, 10-day ensemble streamflow predictions are evaluated against a reference simulation which uses observed meteorological fields as input to a calibrated hydrological model. Performance scores are displayed over different regions, forecast lead times, basin sizes, as well as in time, considering average scores for moving 12-month windows of forecasts. Skilful predictions are found in medium to large rivers over the whole 10-day range. On average, performance drops significantly in river basins with upstream area smaller than 300 km2, partly due to underestimation of the runoff in mountain areas. Model limitations and recommendations to improve the evaluation framework are discussed in the final section.},

	title = {Flash flood forecasting based on rainfall thresholds},
	abstract = {Extreme rainstorms often trigger catastrophic flash floods in Europe and in several areas of the world. Despite notable advances in weather forecasting, most operational early warning systems for extreme rainstorms and flash floods are based on rainfall observations derived from rain gauge networks and weather
radars, rather than on forecasts. As a result, warning lead times are bounded to few hours, and warnings are usually issued when the event is already taking place. This chapter illustrates three recently developed systems that use information on observed and forecasted precipitation to issue flash flood warnings. The first
approach is an indicator for heavy precipitation events, developed to complement the flood early warning of the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) and targeted to short and intense events, possibly leading to flash flooding in small catchments. The system is based on the European Precipitation Index Based on Simulated Climatology (EPIC), which in EFAS is computed using COSMOLEPS ensemble weather forecasts and a 20-year consistent reforecast dataset. The second system is a flash flood early warning tool developed based on precipitation statistics. A total of 759 sub-catchments in southern Switzerland is considered. Intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves for each catchment have
been calculated based on gridded precipitation products for the period 1961–2012 and gridded reforecast of the COSMO-LEPS for the period 1971–2000. The different IDF curves at the catchment level in combination with precipitation forecasts are the basis for the flash flood early warning tool. The forecast models used are COSMO-2 (deterministic, updated every 3 h and with a lead time of
24 h) and COSMO-LEPS (probabilistic, 16-member and with a lead time of 5 days). The third system (FF-EWS) uses probabilistic high-resolution precipitation products generated from the observations of the weather radar network to monitor situations prone to trigger flash floods in Catalonia (NE Spain). These ensemble precipitation estimates and nowcasts are used to calculate the basin-aggregated
rainfall (that is, the rainfall accumulated upstream of each point of the drainage network), which is the variable used to characterize the potential flash flood hazard. Examples of successful and less skilful forecasts for all three systems are shown and commented to highlight pros and cons.},

	abstract = {The deadly combination of short to no warning lead times and the vulnerability of urbanized areas makes flash flood events extremely dangerous for the modern society. This paper contributes to flash flood early warning by proposing a multi-stage warning system for heavy precipitation events based on threshold exceedances within a probabilistic framework. It makes use of meteorological products at different resolutions, namely, numerical weather predictions (NWP), radar-NWP blending, and radar nowcasting. The system is composed by two main modules. First, a European Precipitation Index based on a simulated Climatology (EPIC) and probabilistic weather forecasts is calculated to pinpoint catchments at risk of upcoming heavy precipitation. Then, a Probabilistic Flash Flood Guidance System (PFFGS) is activated at the regional scale and uses more accurate input data to reduce the estimation uncertainty.
The system is tested for a high flow event occurred in Catalonia (Spain) in November 2008 and results from the different meteorological input data are compared and discussed. The strength of coupling the two systems is shown in its ability to detect areas potentially at risk of severe meteorological conditions and then monitoring the evolution by providing more accurate information with higher spatial-temporal resolution as the event approaches.},

This paper presents the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS), which has been set up to provide an overview on upcoming floods in large world river basins. GloFAS is based on distributed hydrological simulation of numerical ensemble weather predictions with global coverage. Streamflow forecasts are compared statistically to climatological simulations to detect probabilistic exceedance of warning thresholds. In this article, the system setup is described, together with an evaluation of its performance over a two-year test period and a qualitative analysis of a case study for the Pakistan flood, in summer 2010. It is shown that hazardous events in large river basins can be skilfully detected with a forecast horizon of up to 1 month.

This paper aimed to critically review{\textgreater}100 studies about the current evidence of flash floods across different global geographies, focusing on early warning systems, risk and vulnerability assessment, attributable mortality, toxic chemical exposures, and burden of diseases. Considering the infancy of flash flood studies, early warning systems have been well studied mostly in Europe (34 \%), China (30 \%), and South Asia (13 \%). Evidence shows an increasing risk and vulnerability to flash floods. However, there are limited theoretical bases for selecting flash flood vulnerability/risk indicators and a lack of validation of the proposed indices. It was also found that flash floods not only cause increased death among developing countries but are also associated with the incidence of water-borne (e.g., Cholera) and vector-borne (e.g., malaria) diseases. There is evidence of a release of non-threshold toxic chemical contaminants into the environment during flash floods. The study also revealed the release of high-concentration levels of antibiotics in water bodies during flash flood events. Therefore, quantitative health risk assessment and epidemiological studies recommended to understand better the long-term health outcomes associated with these exposures. We recommend that future studies consider applying evidence-based variables and high-resolution data to develop early warning systems, especially in developing countries. Incorporating technologically based early warning systems can enhance lead times and issue reliable alerts and communications while reducing the number of deaths, diseases, and chemical contaminations in flood-prone areas.},

This review aimed to provide systematic evidence of the impact of floods on undernutrition in children under five years of age in Low and Middleincome countries (LMICs).  We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL and Scopus for peer-reviewed articles. Popline, WHO Library database (WHOLIS), the International Disaster database (EM-DAT), Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), UNICEF and Eldis were searched for grey literature articles. Database searches were first conducted in 2016 and updated in 2020. We included English language articles that reported the effect of floods on undernutrition outcomes in children under 5 years of age in LMICs, without limitation to study design and year of publication. The quality of selected studies was assessed using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies.  Of the 5701 articles identified, 14 met our inclusion criteria. The review noted stunting as the most frequently reported significant form of undernutrition in flood-affected areas. Severe and recurrent floods showed the greatest impact on undernutrition. Due to weak and limited evidence, the study is inconclusive on the most significant forms within the short-term and intermediate periods following floods. On the other hand, stunting was noted as the most frequently reported significant form of undernutrition in the long-term period following floods. There was generally little evidence of the effect of floods on micronutrient deficiencies. Factors associated with child undernutrition in the flood-affected areas included age, gender, diarrhoea, maternal and paternal education, maternal age, household size, land ownership and socioeconomic status. Overall, the quality of the evidence was fairly weak, with the main challenge lying in the inability of the studies to establish causal pathways for the observed effects.  The review suggests clear plans and strategies for preventing and reducing the long-term impact of floods on undernutrition in children under five years. Future research utilising long-term prospective data is indispensable to provide more robust evidence to guide better prevention measures, response decisions and interventions.},

	abstract = {The new Version 2.3 of the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Monthly analysis is described in terms of changes made to improve the homogeneity of the product, especially after 2002. These changes include corrections to cross-calibration of satellite data inputs and updates to the gauge analysis. Over-ocean changes starting in 2003 resulted in an overall precipitation increase of 1.8\% after 2009. Updating the gauge analysis to its ﬁnal, high-quality version increases the global land total by 1.8\% for the post-2002 period. These changes correct a small, incorrect dip in the estimated global precipitation over the last decade given by the earlier Version 2.2. The GPCP analysis is also used to describe global precipitation in 2017. The general La Niña pattern for 2017 is noted and the evolution from the early 2016 El Niño pattern is described. The 2017 global value is one of the highest for the 1979–2017 period, exceeded only by 2016 and 1998 (both El Niño years), and reinforces the small positive trend. Results for 2017 also reinforce signiﬁcant trends in precipitation intensity (on a monthly scale) in the tropics. These results for 2017 indicate the value of the GPCP analysis, in addition to research, for climate monitoring.},

	volume = {541},
	doi = {10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.03.032},
	abstract = {Flash floods represent one of the most destructive natural hazards in the Mediterranean region. These floods result from very intense and spatially heterogeneous rainfall events. Distributed hydrological models are valuable tools to study these phenomena and increase our knowledge on the main processes governing the generation and propagation of floods over large spatial scales. They are generally built using a bottom–up approach that generalizes small-physics representations of processes. However, top–down or data-driven approach is increasingly shown to provide also valuable knowledge. A simplified semi-distributed continuous hydrological model, named SIMPLEFLOOD, was developed, based on the simple dynamical system approach (SDSA) proposed by Kirchner (WRR, 2009, 45, W02429), and applied to the Ardèche catchment in France (2388 km2). This data-driven method assumes that discharge at the outlet of a given catchment can be expressed as a function only of catchment storage. It leads to a 3-parameter nonlinear model according to rainfall and runoff observations. This model was distributed over sub-catchments and coupled with a kinematic wave based flow propagation module. The parameters were estimated by discharge recession analyses at several gauged stations. Parameter regionalization was conducted using a Factorial Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) and Hierarchical Classification on Principal Component (HCPC) in order to find relationships between the SDSA approach and catchments characteristics. Geology was found to be the main predictor of hydrological response variability and model parameters were regionalized according to the dominant geology. The SIMPLEFLOOD model was applied for a 12-year continuous simulation over the Ardèche catchment. Four flash flood events were also selected for further analysis. The simulated hydrographs were compared with the observations at 11 gauging stations with catchment size ranging from 17 to 2300 km2. The results show a good performance of the model for the continuous and flash flood events occurring under wet conditions, whereas the model underestimates discharge for events occurring after a long dry period. The simple modeling approach provided interesting insight into the Ardèche catchment functioning and offers perspective for a better simulation of flash floods, mainly under wet conditions.},

We present a novel benchmark, derived from extensive experiments across diverse datasets, to evaluate the performance gains from class-balanced losses in GBDT models. Our findings establish the efficacy of these loss functions in enhancing model performance under class imbalance, providing actionable insights for practitioners tackling real-world imbalanced data challenges.

A filtering process selected 35 representative papers from various domains, such as health, finance, and engineering. As a result of a thorough quantitative analysis of these papers, this study proposes two taxonomies—illustrating sampling techniques and ML models. The results indicate that oversampling and classical ML are the most common preprocessing techniques and models, respectively. However, solutions with neural networks and ensemble ML models have the best performance—with potentially better results through hybrid sampling techniques.

The GRDC is an international data centre operating under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which collects quality-controlled river discharge data and associated metadata from the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) of WMO Member States. The dataset covers stations from 5,356 catchments and 25 countries, spans the years 1950\&ndash;2023.

It has a flexible and modular design and supports several levels of parallelism to enable training on high-resolution input data.

	abstract = {Research and development of new verification strategies and reassessment of traditional forecast verification methods has received a great deal of attention from the scientific community in the last decade. This scientific effort has arisen from the need to respond to changes encompassing several aspects of the verification process, such as the evolution of forecasting systems, or the desire for more meaningful verification approaches that address specific forecast user requirements. Verification techniques that account for the spatial structure and the presence of features in forecast fields, and which are designed specifically for high-resolution forecasts have been developed. The advent of ensemble forecasts has motivated the re-evaluation of some of the traditional scores and the development of new verification methods for probability forecasts. The expected climatological increase of extreme events and their potential socio-economical impacts have revitalized research studies addressing the challenges concerning extreme event verification. Verification issues encountered in the operational forecasting environment have been widely discussed, verification needs for different user communities have been identified, and models to assess the forecast value for specific users have been proposed. Proper verification practice and correct interpretation of verification statistics has been extensively promoted with recent publications and books, tutorials and workshops, and the development of open-source software and verification tools. This paper addresses some of the current issues in forecast verification, reviews some of the most recently developed verification techniques, and provides recommendations for future research.

	abstract = {Spatial rainfall patterns exert a key control on the catchment-scale hydrologic response. Despite recent advances in radar-based rainfall sensing, rainfall observation remains a challenge, particularly in mountain environments. This paper analyzes the importance of high-density rainfall observations for a 13.4 km2 catchment located in the Swiss Alps, where rainfall events were monitored during 3 summer months using a network of 12 low-cost, drop-counting rain gauges. We developed a data-based analysis framework to assess the importance of high-density rainfall observations to help predict the hydrological response. The framework involves the definition of spatial rainfall distribution metrics based on hydrological and geomorphological considerations and a regression analysis of how these metrics explain the hydrologic response in terms of runoff coefficient and lag time. The gained insights on dominant predictors are then used to investigate the optimal rain gauge network density for predicting the streamflow response metrics, including an extensive test of the effect of down-sampled rain gauge networks and an event-based rainfall–runoff model to evaluate the resulting optimal rain gauge network configuration. The analysis unravels that, besides rainfall amount and intensity, the rainfall distance from the outlet along the stream network is a key spatial rainfall metric. This result calls for more detailed observations of stream network expansions and the parameterization of along-stream processes in rainfall–runoff models. In addition, despite the small spatial scale of this case study, the results show that an accurate representation of the rainfall field (with at least three rain gauges) is of prime importance for capturing the key characteristics of the hydrologic response in terms of generated runoff volumes and delay for the studied catchment (0.22 rain gauges per square kilometer). The potential of the developed rainfall monitoring and analysis framework for rainfall–runoff analysis in small catchments remains to be fully unraveled in future studies, potentially also including urban catchments.},

Nevertheless, biases and the low spatial resolution of global numerical weather prediction (NWP) models can hinder their utility for predictions at a local scale. Statistical post-processing is widely used to correct biases in raw global rainfall forecasts and can address representativeness errors. The most advanced post-processing techniques follow a multivariate approach, using relationships between rainfall observations and multiple predictors to capture physical processes that can influence the corrections applied to the target variable (i.e., raw rainfall forecasts). However, multivariate post-processing is expensive to run and maintain. Post-processing techniques can also follow a univariate approach, adjusting raw rainfall forecasts only through relationships between past forecasts and observed rainfall. Univariate approaches are widely used due to their simplicity and low calibration and production costs. They might also be the only viable approach when the required information to define predictors is unavailable. This study compares the reliability and discrimination ability of rainfall forecasts post-processed with a multivariate and univariate approach to assess whether the former improves performance. While not explicitly evaluated in this study, improved performance is a prerequisite to justifying the multivariate approach’s higher maintenance, calibration, and production costs compared to its univariate counterpart. In this study, we considered the post-processing technique developed at the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) to produce probabilistic rainfall prediction at point-scale called ”ecPoint”. One global forecasting system providing outputs in three different ways, two of which involved postprocessing, were compared: the raw ECMWF ensemble (ENS), the original and currently operational multivariate ecPoint (M-ecPoint), and an experimental univariate ecPoint (U-ecPoint). Compared to U-ecPoint and ENS, M-ecPoint provides better reliability and discrimination ability. It also provides more timely and accurate predictions of ”dry” and ”extremely wet” conditions. Moreover, compared to U-ecPoint, M-ecPoint maintains high detection of low-probability, high-impact extreme rainfall events while reducing false alarms, delivering much higher user confidence.},

	abstract = {Globally, flash floods are one of the costliest natural hazards for property damage and loss of life. The low accuracy of flash flood forecasts beyond a few hours limits their use in early warning systems. This study aims to compare the performance of ECMWF raw ensemble (ENS) and ecPoint rainfall forecasts. These two systems are profoundly different because the first provides forecasts at a grid-scale while the second provides forecasts at a point-scale that mirror point observations such as rain gauges. ecPoint rainfall forecasts have been shown to provide better guidance than ENS in predicting extreme (localized) rainfall up to 10 days ahead. Hence, this study assesses whether ec-Point also enhances ENS performance in identifying areas at risk of flash floods up to medium-range leads. A one-year objective verification was conducted for flash flood events in Ecuador. The country’s varied climate and the existence of a comprehensive database describing the occurrence of flash flood events made Ecuador an attractive site for the verification analysis. Knowing the magnitudes of flash-flood-triggering rainfall events is imperative to carry out the objective verification analysis. The authors did not have this information at their disposal, and suitable rainfall observations were not available to estimate the magnitudes of flash-flood-triggering rainfall events. This study proposes a methodology that uses short-term ecPoint rainfall forecasts as a proxy for point rainfall observations to define the magnitude of flash-flood-triggering rainfall events when suitable rainfall observations are unavailable. Due to the probabilistic nature of the ecPoint output, this approach simulates a very high-density observational network in data-scarce regions. From a general comparison of the rainfall thresholds defined using short-range ecPoint rainfall forecast and those computed from a low-density observational network, overall, the flash-flood-triggering rainfall thresholds seem reasonable, but they might be slightly underestimated in the coastal region and overestimated in the Andean region. The verification results suggest that ecPoint generally provides better guidance than ENS in identifying areas at risk of flash floods when rainfall originates from small-scale convective systems. In these cases, ENS might completely miss the flash flood event, while ecPoint was able to anticipate it. When rainfall originates from large-scale convective systems, ecPoint and ENS performances are comparable, showing that ENS can predict areas at risk of flash floods around the globe up to medium-range leads under certain weather conditions. However, ecPoint provides better guidance on the magnitude of the flash-flood-triggering rainfall events. The findings of this study have the potential to significantly improve early warning systems, aid decision-makers, and enhance emergency preparedness worldwide against flash floods. This would ultimately contribute to better mitigation of the devastating impacts of flash floods on communities and infrastructure.},

New infiltration and runoff schemes are introduced with a dependency on the soil texture and standard deviation of orography. A set of experiments in stand-alone mode is used to assess the improved prediction of soil moisture at the local scale against field site observations. Comparison with basin-scale water balance (BSWB) and Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) datasets indicates a consistently larger dynamical range of land water mass over large continental areas and an improved prediction of river runoff, while the effect on atmospheric fluxes is fairly small. Finally, the ECMWF data assimilation and prediction systems are used to verify the effect on surface and near-surface quantities in the atmospheric-coupled mode.

	abstract = {Flash floods cause more fatalities than any other weather-related natural hazard and cause significant damage to property and infrastructure. It is important to understand the underlying processes that lead to these infrequent but high-consequence events. Accurately determining the locations of flash flood events can be difficult, which impedes comprehensive research of the phenomena. While some flash floods can be detected by automated means (e.g., streamflow gauges), flash floods (and other severe weather events) are generally based on human observations and may not reflect the actual distribution of event locations. The Storm Data–Storm Events Database, which is produced from National Weather Service reports, was used to locate reported flash floods within the forecast area of the Binghamton, New York, Weather Forecast Office between 2007 and 2013. The distribution of those reports was analyzed as a function of environmental variables associated with flood generation including slope, impervious area, soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat, representative rainfall intensity, and representative rainfall depth, as well as human population. A spatial conditional autoregressive model was used to test the hypothesis that flash flood reports are made more frequently in areas with higher populations, even when other flood-generating processes are considered. Slope, soil saturated hydraulic conductivity, and impervious area are significant predictors of flash flood reports. When population is added as a predictor, the model is similarly robust, but impervious area and ksat are no longer significant predictors. These results may challenge the assumption that flash flood reports are strongly biased by population.},

A national flash flood observation database consisting of reports in the NWS publication Storm Data and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauge measurements are used to determine the skill of FFG over a 4-yr period. FFG skill is calculated at several different precipitation-to-FFG ratios for both observation datasets.

When the entire continental United States is considered, the highest observed critical success index (CSI) with 1-h FFG is 0.20 for the USGS dataset, which should be considered a benchmark for future research that seeks to improve, modify, or replace the current FFG system. Regional benchmarks of FFG skill are also determined on an RFC-by-RFC basis. When evaluated against Storm Data reports, the regional skill of FFG ranges from 0.00 to 0.19.

	abstract = {This study compares the disaster damage records of two of the most widely used disaster databases - EM-DAT and DesInventar for a selected sample of 70 countries over the period 1995–2013. We consider four types of natural disasters – droughts, floods, earthquakes and storms and use descriptive statistics to compare the records of the two databases for the selected datasets in terms of all recorded events, matched events and large-scale events along with few country-specific comparisons. We note significant differences in the damage estimates reported in the two selected datasets. The comparison of the damage estimates for all recorded events shows that the DesInventar dataset has greater number of recorded events than the EM-DAT. The descriptive statistics of the former exhibits larger mean and standard deviation across all disaster types compared to that for the latter. The same is true for the comparison of large-scale disaster events and country-specific comparisons with the DesInventar dataset having higher number of recorded events and larger values for descriptive statistics for the selected country-year. On the contrary, for the hand-matched events data, EM-DAT shows larger mean disaster damages along with a higher statistical range compared to the DesInventar dataset. The basic structure of the datasets and the data collection methods may influence the magnitude of the recorded damages along with possible human errors while data entering. The present study further highlights the need for a more systematic and standardized disaster damages database which is critical to achieve the first priority action ‘understanding disaster risk’ of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.},

In this study, a comprehensive statistical approach was applied to future flood predictions in the coastal basin of North Al-Abatinah, Oman. In this context, the initial step involves analyzing eighteen General Circulation Models (GCMs) to identify the most suitable one. Subsequently, we assessed four CMIP6 scenarios for future rainfall analysis. Next, different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were employed through H2O-AutoML to identify the best model for downscaling future rainfall predictions. Forty distribution functions were then fitted to the future daily rainfall, and the best-fit model was selected to project future Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves. Finally, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was utilized with sub-daily time steps to make accurate flash flood predictions in the study area. The findings reveal that IITM-ESM is the most effective among GCM models. Additionally, the application of stacked ensemble ML model proved to be the most reliable in downscaling future rainfall. Furthermore, this study highlighted that floods entering urbanized areas could reach 20.33 and 20.70 m³/s under pessimistic scenarios during rainfall events with 100 and 200-year return periods, respectively. This hierarchical comprehensive approach provides reliable results by utilizing the most effective model at each step, offering in-depth insight into future flash flood prediction.},

	abstract = {Deep learning techniques have been increasingly used in flood management to overcome the limitations of accurate, yet slow, numerical models and to improve the results of traditional methods for flood mapping. In this paper, we review 58 recent publications to outline the state of the art of the field, identify knowledge gaps, and propose future research directions. The review focuses on the type of deep learning models used for various flood mapping applications, the flood types considered, the spatial scale of the studied events, and the data used for model development. The results show that models based on convolutional layers are usually more accurate, as they leverage inductive biases to better process the spatial characteristics of the flooding events. Models based on fully connected layers, instead, provide accurate results when coupled with other statistical models. Deep learning models showed increased accuracy when compared to traditional approaches and increased speed when compared to numerical methods. While there exist several applications in flood susceptibility, inundation, and hazard mapping, more work is needed to understand how deep learning can assist in real-time flood warning during an emergency and how it can be employed to estimate flood risk. A major challenge lies in developing deep learning models that can generalize to unseen case studies. Furthermore, all reviewed models and their outputs are deterministic, with limited considerations for uncertainties in outcomes and probabilistic predictions. The authors argue that these identified gaps can be addressed by exploiting recent fundamental advancements in deep learning or by taking inspiration from developments in other applied areas. Models based on graph neural networks and neural operators can work with arbitrarily structured data and thus should be capable of generalizing across different case studies and could account for complex interactions with the natural and built environment. Physics-based deep learning can be used to preserve the underlying physical equations resulting in more reliable speed-up alternatives for numerical models. Similarly, probabilistic models can be built by resorting to deep Gaussian processes or Bayesian neural networks.},

	abstract = {On 15 February 2022, the city of Petrópolis in the highlands of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, received an unusually high volume of rain within 3 h (258 mm), generated by a strongly invigorated mesoscale convective system. It resulted in flash floods and subsequent landslides that caused the deadliest landslide disaster recorded in Petrópolis, with 231 fatalities. In this paper, we analyzed the root causes and the key triggering factors of this landslide disaster by assessing the spatial relationship of landslide occurrence with various environmental factors. Rainfall data were retrieved from 1977 to 2022 (a combination of ground weather stations and the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation – CHIRPS). Remotely sensed data were used to map the landslide scars, soil moisture, terrain attributes, line-of-sight displacement (land surface deformation), and urban sprawling (1985–2020). The results showed that the average monthly rainfall for February 2022 was 200 mm, the heaviest recorded in Petrópolis since 1932. Heavy rainfall was also recorded mostly in regions where the landslide occurred, according to analyses of the rainfall spatial distribution. As for terrain, 23 \% of slopes between 45–60∘ had landslide occurrences and east-facing slopes appeared to be the most conducive for landslides as they recorded landslide occurrences of about 9 \% to 11 \%. Regarding the soil moisture, higher variability was found in the lower altitude (842 m) where the residential area is concentrated. Based on our land deformation assessment, the area is geologically stable, and the landslide occurred only in the thin layer at the surface. Out of the 1700 buildings found in the region of interest, 1021 are on the slope between 20 to 45∘ and about 60 houses were directly affected by the landslides. As such, we conclude that the heavy rainfall was not the only cause responsible for the catastrophic event of 15 February 2022; a combination of unplanned urban growth on slopes between 45–60∘, removal of vegetation, and the absence of inspection were also expressive driving forces of this disaster.},

Most of the heavy precipitation fell over areas with medium to very high geological vulnerability to landslides and extreme hydrological events. The loss of life and substantial economic impacts in Recife caused by the heavy precipitation of May 2022 and the disasters induced by it show that this city, like many others around the world, has limited capacity to cope with climate extremes. Urbanization has increased population density occupying hills and slopes of the city, contributing to the problem. To reduce the impact of such disasters, residents must be made aware of the risks of climate-related events, and they must be encouraged to heed alerts warning of natural disasters issued by state and federal institutions. Efficient monitoring of risk is also needed. Risk management will be viable only when everyone participates, which requires education and cultural change.},

Similarly, a single hydrological model cannot capture all types of flows, such as flood peaks, occurring within a watershed due to the inaccurate representation of the real world processes in their mathematical structure. To focus on these aspects, this study proposes five ‘NWP+HM’ combinations (HM refers to Hydrologic Model) to investigate which combination performs better in providing quality flood forecasts. The EPS obtained from THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) archive are forced into calibrated hydrologic models to generate ensemble flood forecasts (EFFs). The methodology also includes a machine-learning post-processing technique, Quantile Regression Forests (QRF), for temporal correction of bias and under-dispersion in the raw EPS data. The study finds that both the EPS used show similar performance in generating flood forecasts. However, the study demonstrates that the hydrologic model uncertainty has a more significant impact on capturing flood peaks compared to input model uncertainty. Finally, the simulated flood forecasts are verified for their quality using both deterministic and probabilistic metrics. For the above five combinations, an increase in leadtime up to 10 days is observed when the raw data are post-processed using QRF technique. The study identifies a computationally efficient ‘NWP+HM’ combination for use in the hydrological forecasting system, which improves the predictability of flood forecasts several days ahead.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.103785},
	abstract = {Non-structural mitigation measures to the globally increasing flood events include forecast based alert generation. However, the extreme rainfall forecasts are associated with low hit rate, high false alarm, and spatiotemporal bias; which makes it difficult to rely on them. Further, the losses due to flood in a region not only depend on rainfall severity but also on topography, socioeconomic conditions and exposure of the region to floods. Here, we introduce a new concept of spatial flood risk mapping and forecasting at weather to medium range based on forecasted hazard, embedded with vulnerability (topographic and socioeconomic) and exposure information. We define hazard as the probability of extreme rainfall event during upcoming days given an available weather forecast for the same days. As hindcast is used for computation of probabilities, hazard contains prior information about the false alarm, hit rate and spatiotemporal bias of the forecast. Vulnerability is calculated by averaging the topographic and socioeconomic indicators, and exposure is calculated using a land use land cover map. Topographic vulnerability is computed with digital elevation model using Height Above the Nearest Drainage method, and Data Envelopment Analysis is performed to derive the socioeconomic vulnerability based on the demographic census data. For a specific region and a specific event, the relative flood risk maps are generated at an administrative level (e.g., district, subdistrict or village level for India) and the high-risk areas can be identified from those maps for mitigation. The methodology is demonstrated for a very recent extremely severe flood event that happened in Kerala, India in August 2018. It is evident from the results that the high-risk areas forecasted well in advance (as high lead time as 15 days) match fairly well with the areas, which suffered maximum losses because of direct flood.},

	abstract = {Following the developments in short- and medium-range weather forecasting over the last decade, operational flood forecasting also appears to show a shift from a so-called single solution or 'best guess' deterministic approach towards a probabilistic approach based on ensemble techniques. While this probabilistic approach is now more or less common practice and well established in the meteorological community, operational flood forecasters have only started to look for ways to interpret and mitigate for end-users the prediction products obtained by combining so-called Ensemble Prediction Systems (EPS) of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models with rainfall-runoff models. This paper presents initial results obtained by combining deterministic and EPS hindcasts of the global NWP model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) with the large-scale hydrological model LISFLOOD for two historic flood events: the river Meuse flood in January 1995 and the river Odra flood in July 1997. In addition, a possible way to interpret the obtained ensemble based stream flow prediction is proposed.},

	abstract = {Flood forecasting may be improved by coupling atmospheric and hydrological models. To investigate the current potential of such an approach in complex mountain watersheds, the authors carried out a number of combined high-resolution one-way driven model experiments to generate runoff hydrographs for seven extreme flood events which occurred in the Lago Maggiore basin between 1993 and 2000. The Alpine Ticino–Verzasca–Maggia basin (2627km2) is located directly to the south of the main Alpine ridge embracing a great part of the drainage area of Lago Maggiore. For this basin, the grid-based hydrological catchment model WaSiM-ETH was employed to determine the continuous runoff hydrographs. In the model experiments, two different sets of meteorological input data were used: (1) surface observation data from station measurements and from weather radar, and (2) forecast data from five different high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) models with grid cell sizes between 2 and 14km. This paper presents and compares selected results of these flood runoff simulations with particular attention to the experimental design of the model coupling. The configuration and initialization of the hydrological model runs are outlined as well as the down-scale techniques which proved to provide an adequate spatial interpolation of the meteorological variables onto the 500m×500m grid of the hydrological model. In order to evaluate the various hydrological model results as generated from the different outputs from the five NWP models, some coupled experiments with ‘non-standard’ NWP model outputs have been carried out. In particular, the results of these sensitivity studies point to inherent limits of high-resolution flood runoff predictions in complex mountain terrain.},

EF5 features multiple water balance models and two routing schemes which can be used to generate ensemble forecasts of streamflow, streamflow normalized by upstream basin area (i.e., unit streamflow), and soil saturation. EF5 is designed to utilize high-resolution precipitation forcing datasets now available in real time. A study on flash-flood-scale basins was conducted over the conterminous United States using gauged basins with catchment areas less than 1000 km2. The results of the study show that the three uncalibrated water balance models linked to kinematic wave routing are skillful in simulating streamflow.},

	abstract = {There are ongoing efforts to move beyond the current paradigm of using deterministic products driven by observation-only data to make binary warning decisions. Recent works have focused on severe thunderstorm hazards, such as hail, lightning, and tornadoes. This study discusses one of the first steps toward having probabilistic information combined with convective-scale short-term precipitation forecasts available for the prediction and warning of flash flooding. Participants in the Hydrometeorology Testbed–MRMS Hydrology (HMT-Hydro) experiment evaluated several probabilistic-based hydrologic model output from the probabilistic Flooded Locations and Simulated Hydrographs (PRO-FLASH) system during experimental real-time warning operations. Evaluation of flash flood warning performance combined with product surveys highlighted how forecasters perceived biases within the probabilistic information and how the different probabilistic approaches influenced warnings that were verified versus those that were unverified. The incorporation of the Warn-on-Forecast System (WoFS) ensemble precipitation forecasts into the PRO-FLASH product generation provided an opportunity to evaluate the first coupling of subhourly convective-scale ensemble precipitation forecasts with probabilistic hydrologic modeling at the flash flood warning time scale through archived case simulations. The addition of WoFS precipitation forecasts resulted in an increase in warning lead time, including four events with ≥29 min of additional lead time but with increased probabilities of false alarms. Additional feedback from participants provided insights into the application of WoFS forecasts into warning decisions, including how flash flood expectations and confidence evolved for verified flash flood events and how forecast probabilistic products can positively influence the communications of the potential for flash flooding.},

Accurate and timely warnings are critical for mitigating flood risks2, but hydrological simulation models typically must be calibrated to long data records in each watershed. Here we show that artificial intelligence-based forecasting achieves reliability in predicting extreme riverine events in ungauged watersheds at up to a five-day lead time that is similar to or better than the reliability of nowcasts (zero-day lead time) from a current state-of-the-art global modelling system (the Copernicus Emergency Management Service Global Flood Awareness System). In addition, we achieve accuracies over five-year return period events that are similar to or better than current accuracies over one-year return period events. This means that artificial intelligence can provide flood warnings earlier and over larger and more impactful events in ungauged basins. The model developed here was incorporated into an operational early warning system that produces publicly available (free and open) forecasts in real time in over 80 countries. This work highlights a need for increasing the availability of hydrological data to continue to improve global access to reliable flood warnings.},

	abstract = {Losses from catastrophic floods are driving intense efforts to increase preparedness and improve response to disastrous flood events by providing early warnings. Yet accurate flood forecasting remains a challenge due to uncertainty in modeling, calibrating, and validating a useful early warning system. This paper presents the Requisitely Simple (ReqSim) flood forecasting system that includes key variables and processes of basin hydrology and atmospheric forcing in a data-driven modeling framework. The simplicity of the modeling structure and data requirements of the system allows for customization and implementation in any medium to large rain-fed river basin globally, provided there are water level or discharge measurements at the forecast locations. The proposed system's efficacy is demonstrated in this paper through providing useful forecasts for various river basins around the world. This include 3–10-day forecasts for the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers in South Asia, 2–3-day forecast for the Amur and Yangtze rivers in East Asia, 5–10-day forecasts for the Niger, Congo and Zambezi rivers in West and Central Africa, 6–8-day forecasts for the Danube River in Europe, 2–5-day forecasts for the Parana River in South America, and 2–7-day forecasts for the Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, and Arkansas rivers in the USA. The study also quantifies the effect of basin size, topography, hydrometeorology, and river flow controls on forecast accuracy and lead times. Results indicate that ReqSim's forecasts perform better in river systems with moderate slopes, high flow persistence, and less flow controls. The simple structure, minimal data requirements, ease of operation, and useful operational accuracy make ReqSim an attractive option for effective real-time flood forecasting in medium and large river basins worldwide.},

	volume = {173},
	abstract = {Flash flood, a type of the surface runoff that rises up and down sharply in small watersheds in the hilly and mountainous areas, is a difficulty in flood control and disaster prevention. As a basic unit of people’s social life, community is the most widely involved unit in disaster risk management. Flood-prone communities are characterized by geographical dispersion and confinement. This study carries out a research on disaster resilience and time-varying effects from the perspective of flash flood, and proposes a multidisciplinary integrated approach: (1) A multilevel interpretive structure model of the influencing factors of community resilience based on coupling decision mathematical model was constructed to analyze the differential influencing factors of community resilience; (2) The information diffusion method was used to quantitatively analyze and rank the community resilience of flash flood disasters; (3) Rand Index was used to quantitatively estimate the magnitude of community resilience and analyze the characteristics of its time-varying effect curve. Taking the flood-prone areas in northern Guangdong Province as the research area, this study analyzes three types of communities, including urban, rural, and suburban. The results show that the community resilience indicator system from the perspective of flash flood impact is a multi-dimensional and multi-layered complex network system. The direct influencing factors of community resilience in different types of community are different, the construction of water supply and drainage facilities and the flood emergency drills, as the fundamental influencing factors of community resilience, play an essential role in enhancing community resilience to flash floods. Since most of the surveyed communities are located in areas with frequent flash floods, residents have a high awareness of disaster prevention and mitigation, and rural show the higher community resilience than the sample of urban and suburban. With the expansion of inundation, the resilience of all three types of communities shows a consistent trend of “sharp decrease − rapid increase − slow decrease”. This study can provide an important reference for enhancing the community resilience in the flood-prone areas, and also improving their disaster prevention and mitigation capabilities. This comprehensive analysis method can provide scientific support to the refined prevention and mitigation of other types of disasters.},

	abstract = {Flood susceptibility modeling is crucial for rapid flood forecasting, disaster reduction strategies, evacuation planning, and decision-making. Machine learning (ML) models have proven to be effective tools for assessing flood susceptibility. However, most previous studies have focused on individual models or comparative performance, underscoring the unique strengths and weaknesses of each model. In this study, we propose a stacking ensemble learning algorithm that harnesses the strengths of a diverse range of machine learning models. The findings reveal the following: (1) The stacking ensemble learning, using RF-XGB-CB-LR model, significantly enhances flood susceptibility simulation. (2) In addition to rainfall, key flood drivers in the study area include NDVI, and impervious surfaces. Over 40},

	abstract = {Impact-based forecasts and warnings (IbFWs) are used by meteorological agencies to forecast the likelihood and severity of impacts resulting from hydrometeorological hazards. Despite progress developing IbFW approaches the evaluation of IbFWs performance is challenging, partly due to the lack of impact observations. Impact data may provide the observations required to evaluate IbFWs, and publicly accessible impact data are available from a number of diverse sources. However, differences in the purpose, format, and method of collection across agencies has led to a fragmented and inconsistent picture of impacts to date. Furthermore, impact data can suffer from bias. To understand the implications of using impact data for IbF evaluation, we interrogate a range of publicly available impact data sources including structured databases, disaster reports, and dedicated web and news sites. Bias within publicly available impact data was assessed, and the implication of bias on IbFW evaluation considered. We find that each data source investigated has bias, although the type and magnitude of bias varies depending on the data source. Observed biases affect the coverage, severity, timing, geographic scale, and accuracy of impact observations. Furthermore, inconsistences in hazard terminology, poor adoption of unique event identifiers, and the inability to relate impact observations to specific hazardous events presents challenges when using impact data for IbFW evaluation. Despite these challenges, using a range of data sources together can provide a more holistic observation of the impacts of hydrometeorological events. Consolidating impact observations from a range of sources may produce the data required for IbFW evaluation.},

The peak unit discharge of major rivers also reflects precipitation-generating mechanisms. The flood hydroclimatology of the major rivers of low latitudes, such as the Amazon, Congo, and Zambezi, shows low variability in monthly and annual peak discharge. Rivers of arid and semiarid regions are distinguished by generally low values of peak discharge per unit drainage area because some part of the basin does not effectively contribute surface runoff during peak discharges. The rivers of the mid-latitudes of North America and Europe have climates in which diverse circulation patterns produce precipitation. The rivers of East and Southeast Asia, which drain mostly the mid-latitudes, have seasonally or perennially barotropic climates.},

Flash floods occurrences were extracted from the DISASTER database. We extracted the accumulated precipitation from the Copernicus database by considering two days of duration. The analysed predisposing factors for flooding were extracted considering the whole basin where each occurrence is located. These factors include the basin area, the predominant lithology, drainage density, and the mean or median values of elevation, slope, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), roughness, and four soil properties. The Random Forest algorithm was used to build the models and obtained mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) around 19},

	doi = {10.1002/bdr2.2443},
	abstract = {Infant mortality remains a critical public health issue, reflecting the overall health and well-being of a population. Accurate prediction of infant mortality is crucial, as it enables healthcare providers to identify at-risk populations and implement targeted interventions. By analyzing factors such as maternal education, prenatal care access, nutrition, and environmental influences, predictions help in designing effective programs aimed at reducing infant deaths. This research paper aims to predict infant mortality in India by employing ensemble learning techniques, specifically eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), stacking, adaptive boosting, and bagging. The data for the analysis are sourced from national surveys and demographic studies focusing on infant mortality in India. The collected data underwent rigorous preprocessing steps to prepare it for predictive modeling. Each ensemble learning model is applied to predict infant mortality rates based on the preprocessed data. The XGBoost handles complex and non-linear relationships within the data, and the stacking model is used for the accurate and robust predictions. The adaptive boosting model iteratively trains multiple weak learners, which makes the predictive model as stronger. The adaptive boosting technique enhances the performance of weak classifiers while effectively addressing class imbalance issues. Further, the bagging approach is implemented to derive the linear and non-linear relationships of infant mortality. Models were optimized using k-fold cross-validation to fine-tune their hyper parameters. The predictive ability of the ensemble techniques is analyzed by deploying using different performance parameters. XGBoost attained superior performance results, with a 98.75},

	abstract = {This study addresses the challenges of flash flood susceptibility mapping in Yemen’s Qaa’Jahran Basin, characterized by complex terrain and limited hydro-meteorological data. To enhance predictive accuracy, we integrate metaheuristic feature selection with ensemble learning models. Initially, fifteen flash flood variables were retrieved using Geographic Information System (GIS) based remote sensing, setting the stage for a novel feature selection algorithm. Then, the Memo Search Algorithm (MSA), a metaheuristic approach is proposed to efficiently reduce feature space. Through comprehensive comparisons with established algorithms such as the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO), MSA refined the selection, identifying 'elevation’ and 'distance to streams’ as optimal factors. Statistical validations using the Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests confirmed the significant superiority of MSA over competing algorithms. Ensemble classifiers (bagging, boosting, stacking) were then applied to the reduced feature space. Comprehensive evaluation revealed the boosting ensemble with MSA outperformed traditional techniques reaching 98.75},

We then put all scenarios into context with 200-year return levels and with flood peaks simulated for the June 2024 flood event in southern Germany. We conclude that local counterfactual scenarios are transparent and credible and could complement the anticipation of low-probability events.},

Unprecedented rainfall-induced hydrometeorological disasters and flash floods are increasingly occurring worldwide. Comprehensive efforts are conducted to simultaneously combine multiple disciplines into integrated modelling framework approaches to reduce disaster resilience. This enables more accurate hindcasts, reanalyses, real-time forecasts or nowcasts for flash floods. This study integrates proposed hydrological calibration approach with meteorological input. Two real-time rainfall forecasts by the Weather Research and Forecasting model forced by the Atmospheric Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) and the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA55) were used as input data to the hydrological model ensemble parameterized previously. This approach was applied to seven major rivers to evaluate river discharges real-time forecasts accuracy during the Heavy Rainfall Event of July 2018. Long lead-times of up to 29 h with a satisfactory reproducible range of Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency were obtained using both meteorological forecast for all rivers cumulatively. This indicates that the proposed integrated hydrometeorological approach enables accurate flash flood real-time forecasting for this event. Similarly, the joint hydrometeorological approach enables framework for development of real-time flash food forecasting application in Japan and presumably worldwide.},

	abstract = {The present study investigates into genesis, intensification, dynamical behavior and the prediction of Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm (ESCS) ‘Fani' over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) in the National Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) global numerical weather prediction (NWP) modeling system ‘NCUM.’ The global model is adopted from the UK Met office's Unified Model (UM). The ESCS ‘Fani' formed from 26 April–04 May 2019, over the warm waters of BoB. In the criterion of landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs), which crossed the Orissa coast, it was the most intense cyclonic storm during pre-monsoon season since 1965. The TC exhibited a markedly different characteristic having genesis very near to the equator (near 2.7°N and 88.7°E) and possessing one of the longest tracks ( 3030-km) over the BoB region. The NCUM global model was operationally run during the occurrence of the TC. The diagnosis of the TC's genesis and rapid intensification (RI) in the model is carried out using various metrics such as Genesis potential parameter (GPP), winds at 850-hPa, vertically integrated moisture flux, potential vorticity (PV) at isentropic level 315 K, Severe Weather Threat (SWEAT) index and daily averaged latent heat flux, etc. It is found that the early genesis, structure, RI, and movement of the TC were well captured by the model in advance. The Model predicted TC tracks for a total of seven initial conditions (from 27 April to 03 May 2019, at 24-h interval) are found closely co-related with the observed best track of the TC provided by India Meteorological Department (IMD). The lower values of Direct Position Errors (DPEs), along-track errors (ATEs), and cross-track errors (CTEs) indicate the skillful prediction of the TC by the model. The structure, amplitude, and location (SAL) simulated precipitation of the TC over the BoB and along the central-east coast of India are in agreement with the observed systems. Our detailed diagnostic analysis suggests that the TC formation, development, and intensification was mostly controlled by the warmer BoB sea surface temperatures.},

These models provide a scientific basis for water resource management, flood forecasting, and ecological protection. Process-based models simulate the physical mechanisms of watershed hydrological processes, while data-driven models leverage large datasets and advanced machine learning algorithms. This paper reviewed and compared methods for assessing and enhancing the extrapolability of both model types, discussing their prospects and limitations. Key strategies include the use of leave-one-out cross-validation and similarity-based methods to evaluate model performance in ungauged regions. Deep learning, transfer learning, and domain adaptation techniques are also promising in their potential to improve model predictions in data-sparse and extreme conditions. Interdisciplinary collaboration and continuous algorithmic advancements are also important to strengthen the global applicability and reliability of hydrological models.},

	doi = {10.1175/JHM-D-19-0270.1},
	abstract = {Reliable reanalysis products can be exploited to drive mesoscale numerical models and generate high-resolution reconstructions of high-impact weather events. Within this framework, regional weather and climate models may greatly benefit from the recent release of the ERA5 product, an improvement to the ERA-Interim dataset. In this study, two different convection-permitting models driven by these two reanalysis datasets are used to reproduce three heavy precipitation events affecting a Mediterranean region. Moreover, different sea surface temperature (SST) initializations are tested to assess how higher-resolution SST fields improve the simulation of high-impact events characterized by strong air–sea interactions. Finally, the coupling with a distributed hydrological model allows evaluating the impact at the ground, specifically assessing the possible added value of the ERA5 dataset for the high-resolution simulation of extreme hydrometeorological events over the Calabria region (southern Italy). Results, based on the comparison against multiple-source precipitation observations, show no clear systematic benefit to using the ERA5 dataset; moreover, intense convective activity can introduce uncertainties masking the signal provided by the boundary conditions of the different reanalyses. The effect of the high-resolution SST fields is even more difficult to detect. The uncertainties propagate and amplify along the modeling chain, where the spatial resolution increases up to the hydrological model. Nevertheless, even in very small catchments, some of the experiments provide reasonably accurate results, suggesting that an ensemble approach could be suitable to cope with uncertainties affecting the overall meteo-hydrological chain, especially for small catchments.},

	note = {tex.abstracts: Pluvial flooding can have devastating effects, both in terms of loss of life and damage. Predicting pluvial floods is difficult and many cities do not have a hydrodynamic model or an early warning system in place. Citizen science and crowdsourcing have the potential for contributing to early warning systems (EWS) and can also provide data for validating flood forecasting models. Although there are increasing applications of citizen science and crowdsourcing in fluvial hydrology, less is known about activities related to pluvial flooding. Hence the aim of this paper is to review current activities in citizen science and crowdsourcing with respect to applications of pluvial flooding. Based on a search in Scopus, the papers were first filtered for relevant content and then classified into four main themes. The first two themes were divided into (i) applications relevant during a flood event, which includes automated street flooding detection using crowdsourced photographs and sensors, analysis of social media, and online and mobile applications for flood reporting; and (ii) applications related to post-flood events. The use of citizen science and crowdsourcing for model development and validation is the third theme while the development of integrated systems is theme four. All four main areas of research have the potential to contribute to EWS and build community resilience. Moreover, developments in one will benefit others, e.g., further developments in flood reporting applications and automated flood detection systems will yield data useful for model validation.},

	doi = {10.1175/MWR-D-18-0452.1},
	abstract = {Two sets of global, 132-h (5.5-day), 10-member ensemble forecasts were produced with the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) for 35 cases in April and May 2017. One MPAS ensemble had a quasi-uniform 15-km mesh while the other employed a variable-resolution mesh with 3-km cell spacing over the conterminous United States (CONUS) that smoothly relaxed to 15 km over the rest of the globe. Precipitation forecasts from both MPAS ensembles were objectively verified over the central and eastern CONUS to assess the potential benefits of configuring MPAS with a 3-km mesh refinement region for medium-range forecasts. In addition, forecasts from NCEP’s operational Global Ensemble Forecast System were evaluated and served as a baseline against which to compare the experimental MPAS ensembles. The 3-km MPAS ensemble most faithfully reproduced the observed diurnal cycle of precipitation throughout the 132-h forecasts and had superior precipitation skill and reliability over the first 48 h. However, after 48 h, the three ensembles had more similar spread, reliability, and skill, and differences between probabilistic precipitation forecasts derived from the 3- and 15-km MPAS ensembles were typically statistically insignificant. Nonetheless, despite fewer benefits of increased resolution for spatial placement after 48 h, 3-km ensemble members explicitly provided potentially valuable guidance regarding convective mode throughout the 132-h forecasts while the other ensembles did not. Collectively, these results suggest both strengths and limitations of medium-range high-resolution ensemble forecasts and reveal pathways for future investigations to improve understanding of high-resolution global ensembles with variable-resolution meshes.},

	title = {Heavy rainfall and flash flooding},
	abstract = {Heavy precipitation, which in many contexts is welcomed because it provides the water necessary for agriculture and human use, in other situations is responsible for deadly and destructive flash flooding. Over the 30-year period from 1986 to 2015, floods were responsible for more fatalities in the United States than any other convective weather hazard (www.nws.noaa.gov/om/hazstats.shtml), and similar findings are true in other regions of the world. Although scientific understanding of the processes responsible for heavy rainfall continues to advance, there are still many challenges associated with predicting where, when, and how much precipitation will occur. Common ingredients are required for heavy rainfall to occur, but there are vastly different ways in which the atmosphere brings the ingredients together in different parts of the world. Heavy precipitation often occurs on very small spatial scales in association with deep convection (thunderstorms), factors that limit the ability of numerical models to represent or predict the location and intensity of rainfall. Furthermore, because flash floods are dependent not only on precipitation but also on the characteristics of the underlying land surface, there are fundamental difficulties in accurately representing these coupled processes. Areas of active current research on heavy rainfall and flash flooding include investigating the storm-scale atmospheric processes that promote extreme precipitation, analyzing the reasons that some rainfall predictions are very accurate while others fail, improving the understanding and prediction of the flooding response to heavy precipitation, and determining how heavy rainfall and floods have changed and may continue to change in a changing climate.},

In this event, a quasi-stationary mesoscale convective system (MCS) developed near a preexisting mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) in a very moist environment that included a strong low-level jet (LLJ). This nocturnal MCS produced in excess of 300 mm of rain in a small area to the southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Operational model forecasts and simulations using a convective parameterization scheme failed to produce the observed rainfall totals for this event. However, convection-permitting simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model were successful in reproducing the quasi-stationary organization and evolution of this MCS. In both observations and simulations, scattered elevated convective cells were repeatedly initiated 50–75 km upstream before merging into the mature MCS and contributing to the heavy rainfall. Lifting provided by the interaction between the LLJ and the MCV assisted in initiating and maintaining the convection. Simulations indicate that the MCS was long lived despite the lack of a convectively generated cold pool at the surface. Instead, a nearly stationary low-level gravity wave helped to organize the convection into a quasi-linear system that was conducive to extreme local rainfall amounts. Idealized simulations of convection in a similar environment show that such a low-level gravity wave is a response to diabatic heating and that the vertical wind profile featuring a strong reversal of the wind shear with height is responsible for keeping the wave nearly stationary. In addition, the convective system acted to reintensify the midlevel MCV and also caused a distinct surface low pressure center to develop in both the observed and simulated system.},

Considering their devastating impacts, it is primordial to safeguard the exposed population and infrastructure.

The focus of this study was to characterize the extent of the link between hydrologists and crisis managers. It also aimed to determine the limiting and the fostering factors to an effective integration of forecasting in crisis management during flash floods. This was achieved through an extensive and methodological study of available literature in selected platforms. The models encountered were characterized on multiple levels including the physical, geographical and crisis management level. The results revealed a limited link between the two involved parties with limiting factors such as the complexity of the modeling approach, the insufficient projection in the implications of operationality of the models proposed and the financial aspect. On the other hand, acknowledging the threat of flash-floods and conducting cost-benefit analysis were pinpointed as fostering factors. This study showed to reconsider the forecasting methods employed, particularly, the integration of machine learning, and the needs of end-user in these applications in a crisis management context.},

	doi = {10.1002/joc.5030},
	abstract = {The present study aims to investigate how large-scale atmospheric circulation may influence flash floods in Portugal. For this purpose, weather types (WTs) in a northeastern North Atlantic sector are used and flash floods between 1950 and 2003 were identified in six hydrographic basins: three in the north of Portugal and another three in the south of Portugal. An adapted methodology for flash flood detection on daily discharges is applied. A total of 131 flash floods were detected: 35 in the northern basins and 96 in the southern basins. WTs are identified using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 20th Century Reanalysis V2. The sea level pressure composites for flash flood days by WT reveal the large-scale atmospheric patterns underlying their occurrence. The results show that the cyclonic (C) type was strongly associated with flash flood days in the northern basins. The C type pattern features deep low pressure systems north of Iberia, much stronger than average for this WT. For the southern basins, the C type still shows the highest relevance for flood occurrence, but to a lesser extent, since the easterly wind (E) and dual anticyclonic (AA) types also acquire some importance. The flash flood-inducing AA-type events are characterized by atypical largely zonal troughs extending towards Portugal. The flash flood-inducing E type events hint at the occurrence of anomalously strong cut-off low pressure systems over southern Portugal. Although the significance of these systems to precipitation in Portugal was addressed in previous studies, a systematized assessment of their role on flash flood occurrences is herein provided for the first time. The presented flash flood detection methodology can be applied to other regions where hourly flow discharge data are not available, thus being an alternative to the more conventional detection algorithms.},

Recent efforts to improve flash flood forecasts using deep learning have shown promise, yet commonly-used techniques such as long short term memory (LSTM) models are unable to extract potentially significant spatial relationships among input datasets. Here we propose a hybrid approach using a Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) network to predict stream stage heights using multi-modal hydrometeorological remote sensing and in-situ inputs. Results suggest the hybrid network can more effectively capture the specific spatiotemporal landscape dynamics of a flash flood-prone catchment relative to the current state-of-the-art, leading to a roughly 26},

	doi = {10.5194/hess-26-4013-2022},
	abstract = {Google's operational flood forecasting system was developed to provide accurate real-time flood warnings to agencies and the public with a focus on riverine floods in large, gauged rivers. It became operational in 2018 and has since expanded geographically. This forecasting system consists of four subsystems: data validation, stage forecasting, inundation modeling, and alert distribution. Machine learning is used for two of the subsystems. Stage forecasting is modeled with the long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and the linear models. Flood inundation is computed with the thresholding and the manifold models, where the former computes inundation extent and the latter computes both inundation extent and depth. The manifold model, presented here for the first time, provides a machine-learning alternative to hydraulic modeling of flood inundation. When evaluated on historical data, all models achieve sufficiently high-performance metrics for operational use. The LSTM showed higher skills than the linear model, while the thresholding and manifold models achieved similar performance metrics for modeling inundation extent. During the 2021 monsoon season, the flood warning system was operational in India and Bangladesh, covering flood-prone regions around rivers with a total area close to 470 000 km2, home to more than 350 000 000 people. More than 100 000 000 flood alerts were sent to affected populations, to relevant authorities, and to emergency organizations. Current and future work on the system includes extending coverage to additional flood-prone locations and improving modeling capabilities and accuracy.},

	doi = {10.1038/s41598-024-53535-w},
	abstract = {The Himalayan region, characterized by its substantial topographical scale and elevation, exhibits vulnerability to flash floods and landslides induced by natural and anthropogenic influences. The study focuses on the Himalayan region, emphasizing the pivotal role of geographical and atmospheric parameters in flash flood occurrences. Specifically, the investigation delves into the intricate interactions between atmospheric and surface parameters to elucidate their collective contribution to flash flooding within the Nainital region of Uttarakhand in the Himalayan terrain. Pre-flood parameters, including total aerosol optical depth, cloud cover thickness, and total precipitable water vapor, were systematically analyzed, revealing a noteworthy correlation with flash flooding event transpiring on October 17th, 18th, and 19th, 2021. Which resulted in a huge loss of life and property in the study area. Contrasting the October 2021 heavy rainfall with the time series data (2000–2021), the historical pattern indicates flash flooding predominantly during June to September. The rare occurrence of October flash flooding suggests a potential shift in the area's precipitation pattern, possibly influenced by climate change. Robust statistical analyses, specifically employing non-parametric tests including the Autocorrelation function (ACF), Mann–Kendall (MK) test, Modified Mann–Kendall, and Sen's slope (q) estimator, were applied to discern extreme precipitation characteristics from 2000 to 201. The findings revealed a general non-significant increasing trend, except for July, which exhibited a non-significant decreasing trend. Moreover, the results elucidate the application of Meteosat-8 data and remote sensing applications to analyze flash flood dynamics. Furthermore, the research extensively explores the substantial roles played by pre and post-atmospheric parameters with geographic parameters in heavy rainfall events that resulted flash flooding, presenting a comprehensive discussion. The findings describe the role of real time remote sensing and satellite and underscore the need for comprehensive approaches to tackle flash flooding, including mitigation. The study also highlights the significance of monitoring weather patterns and rainfall trends to improve disaster preparedness and minimize the impact of flash floods in the Himalayan region.},

This study evaluates the most widely used machine-learning breast cancer prediction and diagnosis methods. We use synthetic minority over-sampling to handle imbalanced data in the breast cancer diagnosis dataset obtained from the Wisconsin Machine Learning Repository. We use a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Naive Bayes (NB), and well-known ensembles methods like Majority-Voting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost), and Random Forest (RF) for the breast cancer classification. The findings show that the Majority-Voting ensemble method, built on the top three classifiers (LR, SVM, and CART), outperforms all other individual classifiers and offers the highest accuracy of 99.3},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.09.036},
	abstract = {Recent extreme rainfall events have led to frequent flash flood-debris flow hazards in the mountainous regions of western and northern Beijing, China, resulting in significant loss of life and property. To decipher the formation mechanism and hazard characteristics of these local disasters, the July 2023 flash flood-debris flow in Hantai Village (HTV) and Hantai Gully (HTG) of Changping District, Beijing, was selected as the focus of this study. This study acquired topographic and geological data of the study area through regional disaster investigation, field surveys in severely affected regions, and indoor assessments and analyses, utilizing 1: 1000 topographic maps and 1: 20,000 geological maps sourced from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images. Then, the characteristics of rainfall and the associated hazard processes (flash flood and debris flow) were systematically investigated and analyzed. By further exploring the formation mechanism of these events, relevant hazard prevention and mitigation suggestions were proposed. The results indicate that the total flood volume in the upstream channel of HTG is approximately 6870 m3 within 1 h, demonstrating significant destructive power. The leading edge of the flash flood/debris flow exits the gully (the southern entrance of HTV) at an instantaneous speed of 74.47 km/h and maintained a speed of 16.42 km/h by the time it reached the northern exit of HTV (outlet of the HTG), with a movement time of 1.83 min. This brief event duration presents significant challenges for timely evacuation. This catastrophic flash flood-debris flow event is identified as a compound hazard triggered by extreme rainfall from the remnant circulation of Typhoon Doksuri, with the sudden increase in surface runoff amount due to short-term heavy rainfall being the primary cause. It is hypothesized that the debris flow occurred later than the flash flood or during the weakening period of the flash flood and was subsequently eroded by weak flood flows, demonstrating clear characteristics of a mutual transformation between flash flood and debris flow. This study provides fundamental support and reference for hazard prevention and response improvement in other small watersheds.},

While NHs trigger disasters and CC is likely to intensify occurrences of disasters, V and E present major drivers of disasters.

	volume = {18},
	doi = {10.1111/jfr3.70026},
	abstract = {Owing to the increased frequency of short-duration extreme rainfall events caused by climate change, peak flood flows are expected to increase substantially in small and medium-sized rivers (SMRs) with a short time of concentration for a catchment (Tc). Accurate flood forecasts and corresponding evacuation are effective in reducing the number of casualties caused by flash floods in SMRs. Currently, flood forecasting using observed rainfall in SMRs has a short lead time, which often delays the issuance of evacuation orders by local governments. Moreover, the large number of SMRs necessitates a system that can be widely used by local governments for disaster response tasks, such as issuing evacuation orders. Therefore, we developed a system that can accurately predict when river water levels will reach the Flood Risk Level (FRL). This forecasting approach uses the rainfall–runoff–inundation (RRI) model and the H–Q equation. The parameters in the RRI model were optimized using the Shuffled Complex Evolution algorithm developed at the University of Arizona (SCE-UA) to reduce the required time and effort. The system uses real-time water level observation data to sequentially modify the basin state quantities in the RRI model using the particle filter method to improve the water level forecast accuracy. The system was implemented in 200 rivers in Japan with diverse rainfall and geological characteristics and was tested during the flood season. Accuracy verification was conducted when the forecasted water levels were operated within a range of ± 50 cm. The results showed that 75},

	abstract = {This paper presents a system of sensors used in flash flood prediction that offers critical real-time information used to provide early warnings that can provide the minutes needed for persons to evacuate before imminent events. Flooding is one of the most serious natural disasters humans confront in terms of loss of life and results in long-term effects, which often have severely adverse social consequences. However, flash floods are potentially more dangerous to life because there is often little or no forewarning of the impending disaster. The Emergency Water Information Network (EWIN) offers a solution that integrates an early warning system, notifications, and real-time monitoring of flash flood risks. The platform has been implemented in Colima, Mexico covering the Colima and Villa de Alvarez metropolitan area. This platform consists of eight fixed riverside hydrological monitoring stations, eight meteorological stations, nomadic mobile monitoring stations called “drifters” used in the flow, and a sniffer with data muling capability. The results show that this platform effectively compiles and forwards information to decision-makers, government officials, and the general public, potentially providing valuable minutes for people to evacuate dangerous areas.},

	doi = {10.3390/rs17081393},
	abstract = {Flash floods, typically triggered by natural events such as heavy rainfall, snowmelt, and dam failures, are characterized by abrupt onset, destructive power, unpredictability, and challenges in mitigation. This study investigates the spatial distribution patterns and driving mechanisms of rainstorm-induced flash flood disasters in the Yarlung Tsangpo River Basin (YTRB) by integrating topography, hydrometeorology, human activity data, and historical disaster records. Through a multi-method spatial analysis framework—including kernel density estimation, standard deviation ellipse, spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s I and Getis–Ord Gi*), and the optimal parameter geographic detector (OPGD) model (integrating univariate analysis and interaction detection)—we reveal multiscale disaster dynamics across county, township, and small catchment levels. Key findings indicate that finer spatial resolution (e.g., small catchment scale) enhances precision when identifying high-risk zones. Temporally, the number of rainstorm-induced flash floods increased significantly and disaster-affected areas expanded significantly from the 1980s to the 2010s, with a peak spatial dispersion observed during 2010–2019, reflecting a westward shift in disaster distribution. Spatial aggregation of flash floods persisted throughout the study period, concentrated in the central basin. Village density (TD) was identified as the predominant human activity factor, exhibiting nonlinear amplification through interactions with short-duration heavy rainfall (particularly 3 h [P3] and 6 h [P6] maximum precipitations) and GDP. These precipitation durations demonstrated compounding risk effects, where sustained rainfall intensity progressively heightened disaster potential. Topographic and ecological interactions, particularly between elevation (DEM) and vegetation type (VT), further modulate disaster intensity. These findings provide critical insights for risk zonation and targeted prevention strategies in high-altitude river basins.},

Precipitation prediction components are coupled with runoff-generating and flood-routing components through the water mass conservation law and a state estimator which was used for updating the model state variables from real-time observations. The model is capable of operating under the various data availability conditions existing in flash flood prone areas. Sensitivity analysis using data from significant past flash floods indicates that short-term model predictions are not significantly sensitive to the runoff-generating model component when updating is performed. In addition, the sensitivity analysis suggested that model performance is best when all available meteorological and hydrological data are utilized by the state estimator. Remarkably (given the data available for calibration) good predictions of stream stage were obtained by the model for several flash flood cases.},

Results for Sicily (Italy) show how performance of a traditional rainfall event duration and depth power law threshold, yielding a true skill statistic (TSS) of 0.50, can be improved by ANNs (TSS=0.59). Then we show how ANNs allow other variables to be easily added, like peak rainfall intensity, with a further performance improvement (TSS=0.66).

Determining the link between the causes and impacts of floods can make it easier to calculate the level of flood risk. However, up until now, the limitations in quantitative observations for flood-related damages have been a major obstacle when attempting to analyse flood risk in the Mediterranean. Flood-related insurance damage claims for the last 20 years could provide a proxy for flood impact, and this information is now available in the Mediterranean region of Catalonia, in northeast Spain. This means a comprehensive analysis of the links between flood drivers and impacts is now possible. The objective of this paper is to develop and evaluate a methodology to estimate flood damages from heavy precipitation in a Mediterranean region. Results show that our model is able to simulate the probability of a damaging event as a function of precipitation. The relationship between precipitation and damage provides insights into flood risk in the Mediterranean and is also promising for supporting flood management strategies.},

This work presents a comparison of two early warning systems for real-time flash flood hazard forecasting at regional scale. The two systems are based in a gridded drainage network and they use weather radar precipitation inputs to assess the hazard level in different points of the study area, considering the return period (in years) as the indicator of the flash flood hazard. The essential difference between the systems is that one is a rainfall-based system (ERICHA), using the upstream basin-aggregated rainfall as the variable to determine the hazard level, while the other (Flood-PROOFS) is a system based on a distributed rainfall-runoff model to compute the streamflows at pixel scale. The comparison has been done for three rainfall events in the autumn of 2014 that resulted in severe flooding in the Liguria region (Northwest of Italy). The results obtained by the two systems show many similarities, particularly for larger catchments and for large return periods (extreme floods).},

Expert elicitation refers to formal procedures for obtaining and combining expert judgments. Expert elicitation is required when existing data and models cannot provide needed information. This makes validating expert judgments a challenge because they are used when other data do not exist and thus measuring their accuracy is difficult. This article examines the classical model of structured expert judgment, which is an elicitation method that includes validation of the experts’ assessments against empirical data. In the classical model, experts assess both the unknown target questions and a set of calibration questions, which are items from the experts’ field that have observed true values. The classical model scores experts on their performance in assessing the calibration questions and then produces performance-weighted combinations of the experts. From 2006 through March 2015, the classical model has been used in thirty-three unique applications. Less than one-third of the individual experts in these studies were statistically accurate, highlighting the need for validation. Overall, the performance-based combination of experts produced in the classical model is more statistically accurate and more informative than an equal weighting of experts.},

In this paper we review how flash floods are forecast considering the limitations and uncertainty involved in both the meteorological and hydrological aspects of forecasting systems. Data assimilation and the use of ensembles are both key elements across disciplines. Assessing the susceptibility of river catchments to extreme flooding is considered, and statistical methods of estimating the likelihood of extreme rainfall and floods within a changing climate are examined. Ways of constraining flash flood forecasts are noted as one way to improve forecast performance in the future.},

	abstract = {Convection-permitting models (CPMs) have provided weather forecasting centres with a step-change in capabilities for forecasting rainfall. They are now used operationally to forecast precipitation in many parts of the world, including the UK. CPMs are models in which the dynamics of atmospheric convection is treated with sufficient accuracy in order to make it viable to switch off convection parametrization. This review describes the current state-of-the-art in operational CPM-based numerical weather prediction (NWP), primarily within the UK, and the historical development of CPMs. The characteristics of CPM systems and forecasts are highlighted and placed in an international context to recognize similar trends and highlight some differences. It is shown that the realism of CPM-based forecasts can provide improved subjective guidance on convection, and, when measured on appropriate scales, can improve rainfall forecasting skill compared to coarser-resolution NWP. Data assimilation techniques used with operational CPMs are reviewed and given historical context. Examples of new types of observations that may increase the skill of forecasts from improved initial conditions are discussed. CPM-based nowcasting systems are shown to provide considerable improvements in short-range forecasts of rapidly developing, intense systems. As a result, these CPM-based systems provide a new forecasting capability. Finally, the development of CPMs has also required new techniques to verify forecasts and define their skill. These have revealed that the lack of predictability of the smallest scales involving convection means that ensemble techniques are required to represent forecast uncertainty, resulting in a new capability to provide objective forecast probabilities of local precipitation.},

	abstract = {Flash floods are different from common floods because they occur rapidly over short time scales, and they are considered to be one of the most devastating natural hazards worldwide. Mountainous areas with high population densities are particularly threatened by flash floods because steep slopes generate high flow velocities. Therefore, there is a great need to develop an operational forecasting system (OFS) for better flash flood prediction and warning in mountainous regions. This study developed an OFS through the integration of meteorological, hydrological, and hydrodynamic models. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data were used to generate a digital elevation model (DEM). The OFS employs high-density and high-accuracy airborne LiDAR DEM data to simulate rapid water level rises and flooding as the result of intense rainfall within relatively small watersheds. The water levels and flood extent derived from the OFS are in agreement with the measured and surveyed data. The OFS has been adopted by the National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR) for forecasting flash floods every six hours in a mountainous floodplain in Taiwan. The 1D and 2D visualization of the OFS is performed via the National Center for Atmospheric Research Command Language (NCL).},

One suggestion is to communicate the relative risk of extreme weather in the form of odds ratios; but, to the authors’ knowledge, this suggestion has never been tested systematically. The experiment reported here provides an empirical test of this hypothesis. Participants performed a realistic computer simulation task in which they assumed the role of the manager of a road maintenance company and used forecast information to decide whether to take precautionary action to prevent icy conditions on a town’s roads. Participants with forecasts expressed as odds ratios were more likely to take appropriate precautionary action on a single target trial with an extreme low temperature forecast than participants using deterministic or probabilistic forecasts. However, participants using probabilistic forecasts performed better on trials involving weather within the normal range than participants with only deterministic forecast information. These results may provide insight into how best to communicate extreme weather risk. This paper offers clear evidence that people given relative risk information are more inclined to take precautionary action when threatened with an extreme weather event with a low probability than people given only single-value or probabilistic forecasts.},

	abstract = {An experiment has been designed to evaluate and compare precipitation forecasts from a 5-member, 4-km grid-spacing (ENS4) and a 15-member, 20-km grid-spacing (ENS20) Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model ensemble, which cover a similar domain over the central United States. The ensemble forecasts are initialized at 2100 UTC on 23 different dates and cover forecast lead times up to 33 h. Previous work has demonstrated that simulations using convection-allowing resolution (CAR; dx ∼ 4 km) have a better representation of the spatial and temporal statistical properties of convective precipitation than coarser models using convective parameterizations. In addition, higher resolution should lead to greater ensemble spread as smaller scales of motion are resolved. Thus, CAR ensembles should provide more accurate and reliable probabilistic forecasts than parameterized-convection resolution (PCR) ensembles. Computation of various precipitation skill metrics for probabilistic and deterministic forecasts reveals that ENS4 generally provides more accurate precipitation forecasts than ENS20, with the differences tending to be statistically significant for precipitation thresholds above 0.25 in. at forecast lead times of 9–21 h (0600–1800 UTC) for all accumulation intervals analyzed (1, 3, and 6 h). In addition, an analysis of rank histograms and statistical consistency reveals that faster error growth in ENS4 eventually leads to more reliable precipitation forecasts in ENS4 than in ENS20. For the cases examined, these results imply that the skill gained by increasing to CAR outweighs the skill lost by decreasing the ensemble size. Thus, when computational capabilities become available, it will be highly desirable to increase the ensemble resolution from PCR to CAR, even if the size of the ensemble has to be reduced.},

	abstract = {Recently, the use of machine learning in meteorology has increased greatly. While many machine learning methods are not new, university classes on machine learning are largely unavailable to meteorology students and are not required to become a meteorologist. The lack of formal instruction has contributed to perception that machine learning methods are “black boxes” and thus end-users are hesitant to apply the machine learning methods in their everyday workflow. To reduce the opaqueness of machine learning methods and lower hesitancy toward machine learning in meteorology, this paper provides a survey of some of the most common machine learning methods. A familiar meteorological example is used to contextualize the machine learning methods while also discussing machine learning topics using plain language. The following machine learning methods are demonstrated: linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosted decision trees, naïve Bayes, and support vector machines. Beyond discussing the different methods, the paper also contains discussions on the general machine learning process as well as best practices to enable readers to apply machine learning to their own datasets. Furthermore, all code (in the form of Jupyter notebooks and Google Colaboratory notebooks) used to make the examples in the paper is provided in an effort to catalyze the use of machine learning in meteorology.},

	doi = {10.5194/GMD-7-1247-2014},
	abstract = {Both the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) are regularly employed in model evaluation studies. Willmott and Matsuura (2005) have suggested that the RMSE is not a good indicator of average model performance and might be a misleading indicator of average error, and thus the MAE would be a better metric for that purpose. While some concerns over using RMSE raised by Willmott and Matsuura (2005) and Willmott et al. (2009) are valid, the proposed avoidance of RMSE in favor of MAE is not the solution. Citing the aforementioned papers, many researchers chose MAE over RMSE to present their model evaluation statistics when presenting or adding the RMSE measures could be more beneficial. In this technical note, we demonstrate that the RMSE is not ambiguous in its meaning, contrary to what was claimed by Willmott et al. (2009). The RMSE is more appropriate to represent model performance than the MAE when the error distribution is expected to be Gaussian. In addition, we show that the RMSE satisfies the triangle inequality requirement for a distance metric, whereas Willmott et al. (2009) indicated that the sums-of-squares-based statistics do not satisfy this rule. In the end, we discussed some circumstances where using the RMSE will be more beneficial. However, we do not contend that the RMSE is superior over the MAE. Instead, a combination of metrics, including but certainly not limited to RMSEs and MAEs, are often required to assess model performance.},

The High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model is an hourly updated, 3 km model designed for forecasting convective precipitation recently deployed for operational use over the U.S. that initializes latent heating profiles as a function of assimilated radar reflectivity. An object-oriented verification process was developed to validate experimental HRRR convective precipitation forecasts during the 2013 warm season using the NCEP Stage IV multisensor precipitation product. A database of 467 convective precipitation features that were observed during the forecast assimilation period and their corresponding HRRR forecast precipitation features was created. This database was used to evaluate model performance over the entire forecast period, and to relate that performance to model processes, especially those related to precipitation production. Generally, HRRR precipitation is located within 30 km of the observed throughout the forecast period. Validation statistics are best at forecast hour 3, with median biases in mean, maximum, and total rainfall and raining area near 0},

	abstract = {Calibrated high-temporal-resolution precipitation forecasts are desirable for a range of applications, for example, flood prediction in fast-rising rivers. However, high-temporal-resolution precipitation observations may not be available to support the establishment of calibration methods, particularly in regions with low population density or in developing countries. We present a new method to produce calibrated hourly precipitation ensemble forecasts from daily observations. Precipitation forecasts are taken from a high-resolution convective-scale numerical weather prediction (NWP) model run at the hourly time step. We conduct three experiments to develop the new calibration method: (i) calibrate daily precipitation totals and disaggregate daily forecasts to hourly; (ii) generate pseudohourly observations from daily precipitation observations, and use these to calibrate hourly precipitation forecasts; and (iii) combine aspects of (i) and (ii). In all experiments, we use the existing Bayesian joint probability model to calibrate the forecasts and the well-known Schaake shuffle technique to instill realistic spatial and temporal correlations in the ensembles. As hourly observations are not available, we use hourly patterns from the NWP as the template for the Schaake shuffle. The daily member matching method (DMM), method (iii), produces the best-performing ensemble precipitation forecasts over a range of metrics for forecast accuracy, bias, and reliability. The DMM method performs very similarly to the ideal case where hourly observations are available to calibrate forecasts. Overall, valuable spatial and temporal information from the forecast can be extracted for calibration with daily data, with a slight trade-off between forecast bias and reliability.},

	abstract = {One of the most important challenges in atmospheric science and, in particular, in numerical weather predictions (NWP), is to forecast extreme weather events. These events affect very localized areas in space, recording high pluviometric accumulations in short time intervals. In this context, with the present study, we aim to analyze the extreme meteorological event that occurred in the northwestern and eastern parts of Sicily on 15 July 2020, by using the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model. In particular, during the afternoon, several storms affected those areas, causing intense precipitation, with maximum rainfall concentrated on the city of Palermo and in the Etna area. The rainfall at the end of the event reached 134 mm in Palermo and 49 mm in Catania, recorded by the Sicilian network meteorological stations. Because the event at Palermo was strongly localized, the analyses have been carried out by employing different sets of numerical simulations, by means of the WRF model, with horizontal spatial grid resolutions of 9, 3, and 1 km. Furthermore, the output of the performed simulation has been used to assess the thermodynamic profile and atmospheric instability indices. It allowed us to check the adopted parameters against those usually implemented in the flash flood scenario. By using the finest grid resolutions (3 and 1 km), the WRF model was able to provide more accurate predictions of the rainfall accumulation, even if they were strongly localized. Conversely, the implementation of less-refined spatial domain (9 km) did not allow us to obtain predictive estimates of precipitation.},

Heavy precipitation in the region has a large societal impact, causing flash floods. This motivates the forecast performance evaluation of 24-h accumulated precipitation and vertical profiles of atmospheric variables from different numerical weather prediction (NWP) models with the final aim of helping water management in the region. The NWP models evaluated include the Global Forecast System (GFS), which parameterizes convection, and convection-permitting simulations of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model configured by three institutions: University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (UIUC), Colorado State University (CSU), and National Meteorological Service of Argentina (SMN). These models were verified with daily accumulated precipitation data from rain gauges and soundings during the RELAMPAGO-CACTI field campaign. Generally all configurations of the higher-resolution WRFs outperformed the lower-resolution GFS based on multiple metrics. Among the convection-permitting WRF Models, results varied with respect to rainfall threshold and forecast lead time, but the WRFUIUC mostly performed the best. However, elevation-dependent biases existed among the models that may impact the use of the data for different applications. There is a dry (moist) bias in lower (upper) pressure levels which is most pronounced in the GFS. For Córdoba an overestimation of the northern flow forecasted by the NWP configurations at lower levels was encountered. These results show the importance of convection-permitting forecasts in this region, which should be complementary to the coarser-resolution global model forecasts to help various users and decision-makers.],},

For weather and river forecast offices, this is a pressing question given a likely future of increasing high-impact storm events. These offices need to quickly and effectively motivate public response to impending events such as flooding. Currently, communication of flood potential is accomplished through a suite of forecast and warning products, including river hydrographs, precipitation forecasts, and flood watches and warnings. Despite advances in forecast accuracy and lead time, people fail to respond to warnings and often suffer substantial damages and loss of property. To understand how the public uses and interprets National Weather Service (NWS) flood products, an extreme storm scenario was presented using NWS forecast products in a series of focus groups in the Delaware River basin (Pennsylvania–New Jersey). Findings from the sessions informed revisions of the products to which participants reported increased understanding and motivation to take action. Participants demonstrated a strong preference for river-level information presented through the NWS hydrograph among all the NWS products shown depicting an approaching hurricane. Simplified graphics, explanations in general terms, intuitive colors, and geographic specificity are key recommendations to improve comprehension of risk and uncertainty. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NWS are taking steps to operationalize some of these suggestions.

	abstract = {Convection-permitting ensemble prediction systems (CP-ENS) have been implemented in the midlatitudes for weather forecasting time scales over the past decade, enabled by the increase in computational resources. Recently, efforts are being made to study the benefits of CP-ENS for tropical regions. This study examines CP-ENS forecasts produced by the Met Office over tropical East Africa, for 24 cases in the period April–May 2019. The CP-ENS, an ensemble with parameterized convection (Glob-ENS), and their deterministic counterparts are evaluated against rainfall estimates derived from satellite observations (GPM-IMERG). The CP configurations have the best representation of the diurnal cycle, although heavy rainfall amounts are overestimated compared to observations. Pairwise comparisons between the different configurations reveal that the CP-ENS is generally the most skillful forecast for both 3- and 24-h accumulations of heavy rainfall (97th percentile), followed by the CP deterministic forecast. More precisely, probabilistic forecasts of heavy rainfall, verified using a neighborhood approach, show that the CP-ENS is skillful at scales greater than 100 km, significantly better than the Glob-ENS, although not as good as found in the midlatitudes. Skill decreases with lead time and varies diurnally, especially for CP forecasts. The CP-ENS is underspread both in terms of forecasting the locations of heavy rainfall and in terms of domain-averaged rainfall. This study demonstrates potential benefits in using CP-ENS for operational forecasting of heavy rainfall over tropical Africa and gives specific suggestions for further research and development, including probabilistic forecast guidance.},

	abstract = {Floods are recognised as one of the most destructive and costliest natural disasters in the world, which impact the lives and livelihoods of millions of people. To tackle the risks associated with flood disasters, there is a need to think beyond structural interventions for flood protection and move to more non-structural ones, such as flood early warning systems (FEWSs). Firstly, this study aimed to uncover how flood forecasting models in the FEWSs have evolved over the past three decades, 1993 to 2023, and to identify challenges and unearth opportunities to assist in model selection for flood prediction. Secondly, the study aimed to assist in model selection and, in return, point to the data and other modelling components required to develop an operational flood early warning system with a focus on data-scarce regions. The scoping literature review (SLR) was carried out through a standardised procedure known as Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The SLR was conducted using the electronic databases Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) from 1993 until 2023. The results of the SLR found that between 1993 and 2010, time series models (TSMs) were the most dominant models in flood prediction and machine learning (ML) models, mostly artificial neural networks (ANNs), have been the most dominant models from 2011 to present. Additionally, the study found that coupling hydrological, hydraulic, and artificial neural networks (ANN) is the most used ensemble for flooding forecasting in FEWSs due to superior accuracy and ability to bring out uncertainties in the system. The study recognised that there is a challenge of ungauged and poorly gauged rainfall stations in developing countries. This leads to data-scarce situations where ML algorithms like ANNs are required to predict floods. On the other hand, there are opportunities to use Satellite Precipitation Products (SPP) to replace missing or poorly gauged rainfall stations. Finally, the study recommended that interdisciplinary, institutional, and multisectoral collaborations be embraced to bridge this gap so that knowledge is shared for a faster-paced advancement of flood early warning systems.},

Today, ensembles are used not only to provide reliable and accurate forecasts for the short and medium range, the monthly and seasonal time-scale, but also to provide estimates of the initial state of the atmosphere, and to generate future climate projections.

A Slight Risk of excessive rainfall and a Flash Flood Watch were issued 16 and 8 h, respectively, before rain began; however, predicting mesobeta scale extreme rainfall remains an elusive skill for models and humans alike.

	title = {Ensemble forecasting and the need for calibration},
	abstract = {Numerical weather prediction has seen, in the past 25 years, a shift from a ‘deterministic’ approach, based on single numerical integrations, to a probabilistic one, with ensembles of numerical integrations used to estimate the probability distribution function of forecast states. This shift to a probabilistic approach enabled a better extraction of predictive signals at longer lead times and provided a meaningful framework for extending the forecast length beyond 10 days. In this work, the limit of predictive skill is assessed for ECMWF monthly ensemble forecasts at different spatial and temporal scales. The forecast skill horizon is defined as the lead time when the ensemble ceases to be more skilful than a climatological distribution, using a continuous ranked probability score as metric. Results based on 32-day ensemble forecasts indicate that the forecast skill horizon is sensitive to the spatial and temporal scale of the predicted phenomena, to the variable considered and the area analysed. On average over 1 year of forecasts, the forecast skill horizon for instantaneous, grid-point fields is between 16 and 23 days, while it is considerably longer for time- and spatial-average fields. Forecast skill horizons longer than the 2 weeks that were thought to be the limit are now achievable thanks to major advances in numerical weather prediction. More specifically, they are possible because forecasts are now framed in probabilistic terms, with a probability distribution estimated using ensembles generated using forecast models that include more components (e.g. a dynamical ocean and ocean waves) and more faithfully represent processes. Moreover, the forecasts start from more accurate initial conditions constructed using better data-assimilation methods and more observational data.},

This is then used to guide a scientific analysis of the factors that contribute to flash floods in the area using contemporary global datasets, including geomorphology, soil and land-use characteristics, and hydro-meteorological conditions. Our results show that communities interviewed have detailed knowledge of the impacts and drivers of flash floods (deforestation and sedimentation), early warning signs (changes in clouds, wind direction, and rainfall patterns), and distinct hydro-meteorological processes that lead to flash flood events at the beginning and end of the wet season. Our analysis shows that the scientific data corroborate this knowledge and that combining local and scientific knowledge provides improved understanding of flash flood processes within the local context.

	abstract = {Social vulnerability is a key component of the risk equation alongside the context of the hazard and exposure. Increasingly, social vulnerability indices are used to better understand and predict the consequences of disasters, and support the development of improved disaster management policies. Humanitarian organisations particularly strive to capture social vulnerability in their decision processes relative to prioritisation of actions before disasters occur. This research supports the Ecuadorian Red Cross in generating a flood-specific social vulnerability index to inform flash flood early action at the Parroquia level in Ecuador. This paper compares the results from the two most common approaches used to create composite indices, one using the weighting of variables from disaster experts’ judgments (referred to as Expert method) and the other using PCA analysis, with one or more components. While all outcomes reveal similar trends in areas where most indicators suggest the lowest (urban areas) or highest (the Amazon and northwest coastal regions) social vulnerability, the research shows that the choice of the method matters for assessing the social vulnerability in the rest of the country where there are less pronounced vulnerability signals. In those areas, PCA-driven indices suggest higher relative vulnerability levels than Expert outcomes. Further, in the Andes particularly, the PCA outcomes result in wider distribution than the Expert outcomes, and therefore more heterogeneity in the vulnerability assessment. While divergence in outcomes suggests particular attention with the use of composite indexes for decision making, our results provide support to understand the sensitivity in flood-specific social vulnerability outcomes spatially.

	doi = {10.1002/wat2.1520},
	abstract = {Predictions of floods, droughts, and fast drought-flood transitions are required at different time scales to develop management strategies targeted at minimizing negative societal and economic impacts. Forecasts at daily and seasonal scale are vital for early warning, estimation of event frequency for hydraulic design, and long-term projections for developing adaptation strategies to future conditions. All three types of predictions—forecasts, frequency estimates, and projections—typically treat droughts and floods independently, even though both types of extremes can be studied using related approaches and have similar challenges. In this review, we (a) identify challenges common to drought and flood prediction and their joint assessment and (b) discuss tractable approaches to tackle these challenges. We group challenges related to flood and drought prediction into four interrelated categories: data, process understanding, modeling and prediction, and human–water interactions. Data-related challenges include data availability and event definition. Process-related challenges include the multivariate and spatial characteristics of extremes, non-stationarities, and future changes in extremes. Modeling challenges arise in frequency analysis, stochastic, hydrological, earth system, and hydraulic modeling. Challenges with respect to human–water interactions lie in establishing links to impacts, representing human–water interactions, and science communication. We discuss potential ways of tackling these challenges including exploiting new data sources, studying droughts and floods in a joint framework, studying societal influences and compounding drivers, developing continuous stochastic models or non-stationary models, and obtaining stakeholder feedback. Tackling one or several of these challenges will improve flood and drought predictions and help to minimize the negative impacts of extreme events.},

	abstract = {The flash-flood in Braunsbach in the north-eastern part of Baden-Wuerttemberg/Germany was a particularly strong and concise event which took place during the floods in southern Germany at the end of May/early June 2016. This article presents a detailed analysis of the hydro-meteorological forcing and the hydrological consequences of this event. A specific approach, the “forensic hydrological analysis” was followed in order to include and combine retrospectively a variety of data from different disciplines. Such an approach investigates the origins, mechanisms and course of such natural events if possible in a “near real time” mode, in order to follow the most recent traces of the event. The results show that it was a very rare rainfall event with extreme intensities which, in combination with catchment properties, led to extreme runoff plus severe geomorphological hazards, i.e. great debris flows, which together resulted in immense damage in this small rural town Braunsbach. It was definitely a record-breaking event and greatly exceeded existing design guidelines for extreme flood discharge for this region, i.e. by a factor of about 10. Being such a rare or even unique event, it is not reliably feasible to put it into a crisp probabilistic context. However, one can conclude that a return period clearly above 100 years can be assigned for all event components: rainfall, peak discharge and sediment transport. Due to the complex and interacting processes, no single flood cause or reason for the very high damage can be identified, since only the interplay and the cascading characteristics of those led to such an event. The roles of different human activities on the origin and/or intensification of such an extreme event are finally discussed.},

	abstract = {Despite extensive research on disasters induced by natural hazards and climate change, the cumulative effect of many smaller events remains relatively understudied. This is especially true in the Sahel, an increasingly important zone in terms of disaster risk reduction. To what extent do small disasters cumulatively impart substantial losses in the Sahel and how do public and nonprofit decision-makers manage them? To answer these questions, we adopt a mixed methods approach. Analyzing state-level panel data on disasters losses in Senegal and Mali for the decade between 2005 and 2014, we find that small disasters impart as much if not more damage than big disasters and especially affect housing and agriculture. We find that large disasters are concentrated in southern Mali, indicating other areas mainly experiencing small disasters may be overlooked by assistance classically triggered by many deaths from a big event. We distill policy insights from these quantitative findings with ten qualitative interviews, three focus groups, and document analysis. The qualitative findings highlight the challenges of small disasters and the consequences of conflict alongside small disasters. Together, the findings suggest that small disasters lead to significant disruption for vulnerable communities already shouldering burdens of conflict, food insecurity, and environmental degradation.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a coupled observation and modelling strategy aiming at improving the understanding of processes triggering flash floods. This strategy is illustrated for the Mediterranean area using two French catchments (Gard and Ardèche) larger than 2000 km2. The approach is based on the monitoring of nested spatial scales: (1) the hillslope scale, where processes influencing the runoff generation and its concentration can be tackled; (2) the small to medium catchment scale (1–100 km2), where the impact of the network structure and of the spatial variability of rainfall, landscape and initial soil moisture can be quantified; (3) the larger scale (100–1000 km2), where the river routing and flooding processes become important. These observations are part of the HyMeX (HYdrological cycle in the Mediterranean EXperiment) enhanced observation period (EOP), which will last 4 years (2012–2015). In terms of hydrological modelling, the objective is to set up regional-scale models, while addressing small and generally ungauged catchments, which represent the scale of interest for flood risk assessment. Top-down and bottom-up approaches are combined and the models are used as "hypothesis testing" tools by coupling model development with data analyses in order to incrementally evaluate the validity of model hypotheses. The paper first presents the rationale behind the experimental set-up and the instrumentation itself. Second, we discuss the associated modelling strategy.

This system consists of global and regional ensembles, with the global ensemble providing the boundary conditions and initial-condition perturbations for the regional ensemble. Perturbations to the initial conditions are calculated using the ensemble transform Kalman filter, which is a computationally-efficient version of the ensemble Kalman filter. Model uncertainties are represented in the system through a series of schemes designed to tackle the structural and subgrid-scale sources of model error. This paper describes the set-up of the system, and provides justification for the initial-condition and model perturbation schemes chosen. An outline of the structure of the perturbations generated by the system is presented, along with performance results, including verification from case studies and routine running.MOGREPS has been on trial within the operational suite at the Met Office since August 2005. On 20 October 2006 it was decided that this system should be made fully operational, with implementation expected in summer 2008. Results show a good performance.

Along with calibration, discrimination is deemed as a fundamental probabilistic forecast attribute. In particular, in ensemble forecast verification, AUC provides a basis for the comparison of potential predictive skill of competing forecasts. While this approach is straightforward when dealing with forecasts of common events (e.g., probability of precipitation), the AUC interpretation can turn out to be oversimplistic or misleading when focusing on rare events (e.g., precipitation exceeding some warning criterion). How should we interpret AUC of ensemble forecasts when focusing on rare events? How can changes in the way probability forecasts are derived from the ensemble forecast affect AUC results? How can we detect a genuine improvement in terms of predictive skill? Based on verification experiments, a critical eye is cast on the AUC interpretation to answer these questions. As well as the traditional trapezoidal approximation and the well-known binormal fitting model, we discuss a new approach that embraces the concept of imprecise probabilities and relies on the subdivision of the lowest ensemble probability category.},

The results of this analysis serve as a basis for accounting for representativeness error in an ensemble verification process. Uncertainty associated with the scale mismatch between forecast and observation is accounted for by applying a perturbed-ensemble approach before the computation of scores. Verification results reveal a large impact of representativeness error on precipitation forecast reliability and skill estimates.

These latter can give valuable information on both flood dynamics and the related individual and collective responses. This study describes methods for post-flood surveys based on interdisciplinary collaborations between natural and social scientists.

	doi = {10.1002/hyp.7111},
	abstract = {The monitoring of flash-flood events gives us the unique opportunity to observe how catchments respond when most of the surface and subsurface hydrologic flow paths are active. These events often reveal aspects of hydrological behaviour that either were unexpected on the basis of weaker responses or highlight anticipated but previously unobserved behaviour (Delrieu et al., 2005; Archer et al., 2007). Characterizing the response of a catchment during flash-flood events, thus, may provide new and valuable insight into the rate-limiting processes for extreme flood response and their dependency on catchment properties and flood severity. Flash-flood events, however, are difficult to monitor because they develop at space and time scales that conventional measurement networks of rain and river discharges are not able to sample effectively (Creutin and Borga, 2003). As these events are locally rare, they are also difficult to capture during classical field-based experimentation, designed to last a few months over a given region, or on experimental catchments with drainage areas of a few square kilometres. This explains why the investigation of flash-flood events is by necessity event-based and opportunistic as opposed to driven by observations from carefully designed field campaigns. Post-event surveys therefore play a critical role in gathering essential observations concerning flash floods. Traditionally, indirect peak discharge estimates and collection of rainfall maxima have been used to document these events, as well as to provide an answer to the questions that are invariably asked after a major flood: Why did such a major flood occur? How frequently can such a flood be expected to occur? Collectively, these studies contributed to the establishment of regional peak discharge envelope curves and to the development of a better understanding of regional behaviour of extreme floods. However, focus on peak discharges and point rainfall maxima alone provides limited insight into the hydrological controls of flash-flood response.},

This type of scenario is relevant for predicting the risk of localized, intense rainfall events with a duration between 15 min and several hours. Such rainfall events can cause surface‐water (pluvial) flooding. Producing useful forecasts of these events at lead times of more than a few hours is challenging due to the precision and accuracy in rainfall intensity, duration and location that is required. The technique described here addresses these challenges by constructing appropriate scenarios using a neighbourhood technique in combination with ensemble forecasting. It is similar to the distance‐dependent depth–duration analysis described in earlier studies, but it introduces an additional post‐processing step based on probability distribution functions of rainfall accumulation near a location of interest. This additional step makes the reasonable worst‐case scenarios less dependent on grid‐scale behaviour, and helps to generate scenarios with a consistent interpretation. The method is used to compare forecasts with a lead time of 6–36 hr to radar data for several case studies that occurred in Yorkshire. These comparisons also introduce new techniques to present maps of the reasonable worst‐case rainfall accumulation at each location.},

The forecasted inflows serve as the upstream boundary conditions for the hydrodynamic model to forecast the water stage and inundation downstream in the floodplains. A real-time in-situ data-based error correction methodology is applied to maintain the skill of the system. The simulation grid size and time-step of the hydrodynamic model are also optimized for computational efficiency. Historical performance of the framework revealed at least 60},

In this study, we follow a pragmatic approach to analyse the hydro-meteorological pre-conditions of 501 historical damaging floods from 1980 to 2010 in sub-Saharan Africa. These are separated into (a) weather timescale (0–6 days) and (b) seasonal timescale conditions (up to 6 months) before the event. The 7-day precipitation preceding a flood event (PRE7) and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) are analysed for the two timescale domains, respectively. Results indicate that high PRE7 does not always generate floods by itself. Seasonal SPEIs, which are not directly correlated with PRE7, exhibit positive (wet) values prior to most flood events across different averaging times, indicating a relationship with flooding.

	abstract = {Up to now, flash flood monitoring and forecasting systems, based on rainfall radar measurements and distributed rainfall–runoff models, generally aimed at estimating flood magnitudes – typically discharges or return periods – at selected river cross sections. The approach presented here goes one step further by proposing an integrated forecasting chain for the direct assessment of flash flood possible impacts on inhabited areas (number of buildings at risk in the presented case studies). The proposed approach includes, in addition to a distributed rainfall–runoff model, an automatic hydraulic method suited for the computation of flood extent maps on a dense river network and over large territories. The resulting catalogue of flood extent maps is then combined with land use data to build a flood impact curve for each considered river reach, i.e. the number of inundated buildings versus discharge. These curves are finally used to compute estimated impacts based on forecasted discharges. The approach has been extensively tested in the regions of Alès and Draguignan, located in the south of France, where well-documented major flash floods recently occurred. The article presents two types of validation results. First, the automatically computed flood extent maps and corresponding water levels are tested against rating curves at available river gauging stations as well as against local reference or observed flood extent maps. Second, a rich and comprehensive insurance claim database is used to evaluate the relevance of the estimated impacts for some recent major floods.},

	abstract = {A new diagnostic convective closure, which is dependent on convective available potential energy (CAPE), is derived under the quasi-equilibrium assumption for the free troposphere subject to boundary layer forcing. The closure involves a convective adjustment time scale for the free troposphere and a coupling coefficient between the free troposphere and the boundary layer based on different time scales over land and ocean. Earlier studies with the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) have already demonstrated the model’s ability to realistically represent tropical convectively coupled waves and synoptic variability with use of the “standard” CAPE closure, given realistic entrainment rates. A comparison of low-resolution seasonal integrations and high-resolution short-range forecasts against complementary satellite and radar data shows that with the extended CAPE closure it is also possible, independent of model resolution and time step, to realistically represent nonequilibrium convection such as the diurnal cycle of convection and the convection tied to advective boundary layers, although representing the late night convection over land remains a challenge. A more in-depth regional analysis of the diurnal cycle and the closure is provided for the continental United States and particularly Africa, including comparison with data from satellites and a cloud-resolving model (CRM). Consequences for global numerical weather prediction (NWP) are not only a better phase representation of convection, but also better forecasts of its spatial distribution and local intensity.},

However, uncertainties and constraints in forecast skill highlight the need to carefully assess the costs and benefits of the actions in relation to the limitations of forecast information. Forecast skill decreases with increasing lead time, and therefore, an inherent trade-off between timeliness and accuracy exists. In our paper, we present a methodology to assess the potential added value of early warning early action systems (EWEAS), and we explore the decision-makers’ dilemma between acting upon limited-quality forecast information and taking less effective actions. The assessment is carried out for i) an one- and ii) a two-stage action system, in which a first action that is based on a lower skill and longer lead time forecast may be followed up by a second action that is based on a short-term, higher-confidence forecast. Through an idealized case study, we demonstrate that a) that the optimal lead time to trigger action is a function of forecast quality, the local geographic conditions and the operational characteristics of the forecast-based actions and b) low-certainty, long lead time forecasts can become valuable when paired with short-term, higher quality ones in a two-stage action approach.},

However, a quantitative spatially distributed overview of the mechanisms that drive flooding across Europe is currently unavailable. In addition, studies that classify catchments according to their flood-driving mechanisms often identify a single mechanism per location, although multiple mechanisms typically contribute to flood risk. We introduce a new method that uses seasonality statistics to estimate the relative importance of extreme precipitation, soil moisture excess, and snowmelt as flood drivers. Applying this method to a European data set of maximum annual flow dates in several thousand catchments reveals that from 1960 to 2010 relatively few annual floods were caused by annual rainfall peaks. Instead, most European floods were caused by snowmelt and by the concurrence of heavy precipitation with high antecedent soil moisture. For most catchments, the relative importance of these mechanisms has not substantially changed during the past five decades. Exposing the regional mechanisms underlying Europe's most costly natural hazard is a key first step in identifying the processes that require most attention in future flood research.},

In many parts, this evolution strongly deviates from the strategy operational centres have formulated only several years ago. New opportunities in digital technology have greatly accelerated progress, and the full integration of computational science in numerical weather prediction centres is common knowledge now. Within the last few years, a vast machine learning research community has emerged for creating new and tailor-made products, accelerating processing and – most of all – creating emulators for the entire production of global forecasts that outperform traditional systems at the spatial resolution of the training data. In this context, the role of both numerical models and observations is changing from being equation to data driven. Model simulations and reanalyses are becoming the new currency for training machine learning, and operational centres are in a powerful position as they generate these datasets based on decades worth of experience. This environment creates incredible opportunities to progress much faster than in the past but also uncertainties about what the strategic implications on defining cost-effective and sustainable research and operations are, and how to achieve sufficient high-performance computing and data handling capacities. It will take individual national public services a while to understand what to focus on and how to coordinate their substantial investments in staff and infrastructure at institutional, national and international level. This paper addresses this new situation operational weather prediction finds itself in through formulating the most likely “what if?” scenarios for the near future.

	abstract = {Ensemble weather forecasts often under-represent uncertainty, leading to overconfidence in their predictions. Multi-model forecasts combining several individual ensembles have been shown to display greater skill than single-ensemble forecasts in predicting temperatures, but tend to retain some bias in their joint predictions. Established postprocessing techniques are able to correct bias and calibration issues in univariate forecasts, but are generally not designed to handle multivariate forecasts (of several variables or at several locations, say). We propose a flexible multivariate Bayesian postprocessing framework, based on a directed acyclic graph representing the relationships between the ensembles and the observed weather. The posterior forecast is inferred from available ensemble forecasts and an estimate of the shared discrepancy, obtained from a collection of past forecast–observation pairs. We also propose a novel approach to selecting an appropriate training set for estimation of the required correction, using synoptic-scale analogues to obtain a regime-dependent estimate of the adjustment. The proposed technique is applied to forecasts of surface temperature over the UK during the winter period from 2007 to 2013. Although the resulting parametric multivariate-normal probabilistic forecasts are marginally less sharp than those of the leading competitor, they capture the spatial structure of the observations better than a correlation structure based on either the ensembles or climatology alone, and are robust to changes in the variables and spatial domain of the forecast, at a greatly reduced computational cost.},

Accurate flash flood forecasts depend not only on accurate quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs), but also on an understanding of the corresponding hydrologic response. To advance forecast skill, innovative guidance products that blend meteorology and hydrology are needed, as well as a comprehensive verification dataset to identify areas in need of improvement. To address these challenges, in 2013 the Hydrometeorological Testbed at the Weather Prediction Center (HMT-WPC), partnering with the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) and the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL), developed and hosted the inaugural Flash Flood and Intense Rainfall (FFaIR) Experiment. In its first two years, the experiment has focused on ways to combine meteorological guidance with available hydrologic information. One example of this is the creation of neighborhood flash flood guidance (FFG) exceedance probabilities, which combine QPF information from convection-allowing ensembles with flash flood guidance; these were found to provide valuable information about the flash flood threat across the contiguous United States. Additionally, WPC has begun to address the challenge of flash flood verification by developing a verification database that incorporates observations from a variety of disparate sources in an attempt to build a comprehensive picture of flash flooding across the nation. While the development of this database represents an important step forward in the verification of flash flood forecasts, many of the other challenges identified during the experiment will require a long-term community effort in order to make notable advancements.},

For COSMO-DE the ability of the numerical solver to treat small-scale structures has been improved by using a Runge–Kutta method, which allows for the use of higher-order upwind advection schemes. The one-moment cloud microphysics parameterization has been extended by a graupel class, and adaptations for describing evaporation of rain and stratiform precipitation processes were made. Comparisons with a much more sophisticated two-moment scheme showed only minor differences in most cases with the exception of strong squall-line situations. Whereas the deep convection parameterization was switched off completely, small-scale shallow convection was still parameterized by the appropriate part of the Tiedtke scheme. During the first year of operational use, convective events in synoptically driven situations were satisfactorily simulated. Also the daily cycles of summertime 10-m wind and 1-h precipitation sums were well captured. However, it became evident that the boundary layer description had to be adapted to enhance convection initiation in airmass convection situations.
